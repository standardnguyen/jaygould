CHAPTER III
Gould Acquires the Erie
-Ejlected to the Erie board in October, 1867, Gould seemed
to have no important role. To the public, to the railroad man¬
agers, and to speculators and investors he was unknown. Al¬
though for the previous eight years he had been a stockbroker, he
had done little in the financial district to attract public attention.
If he had been successful as a stock speculator, that fact could
have been known only to his intimate associates. On the Erie he
appeared to represent himself only.
Three groups struggled for control of the board. One was led
by Eldridge, who was interested in the Erie only as a means of
safeguarding his substantial investment in the Boston. Another
was represented by Drew, who at that time had little Erie stock,
and a third by Vanderbilt. Although Vanderbilt had been a rail¬
road investor for more than a decade, it was only within the
previous five years that he had become a railroad operator. His
success in the short period was phenomenal. The Hudson River
Railroad and the Harlem had been competitors. Prior to their
acquisition by Vanderbilt, their properties had been in poor
physical condition, and neither had an earnings record to qualify
their securities as investments. By 1864 Vanderbilt, partly by a
number of stock market deals, including the famous Harlem
corner, had acquired control of both roads. The rise in stock
values was spectacular. In 1867 he also secured control of the
New York Central, operating a line from Albany to Buffalo.
With these three properties under his management, he had a
through line from New York City to Buffalo. He then decided
to acquire the Erie and secure control of all the main lines enter¬
ing New York City from the west. Vanderbilt appeared con¬
fident of his position. Since Drew owed his position on the Erie
board to Vanderbilt, he was presumably his friend. There was
no reason why Eldridge, as president of the Erie, should oppose
38

Vanderbilt. Neither did Vanderbilt recognize any danger from
Gould. He knew of Gould only as a stock speculator and believed
that he was on the board only to aid his speculations in Erie
stock.
Gould, however, unknown to Vanderbilt had already entered
into close business relations with both Drew and Eldridge. With
Drew he had concluded a joint trading account. And in order
to increase his importance as a trader, he had also become a
partner in a stock-brokerage house in which Henry N. Smith, a
wealthy speculator, was the dominant personality. After Gould’s
entrance into this firm, its name was changed to Smith, Gould &
Martin.
Gould’s relations with Eldridge were even closer. Although the
facts are not clear, the conclusion is nevertheless suggested that
Gould’s purchase of Erie proxies with funds advanced by El¬
dridge was responsible for the latter’s elevation to the Erie presi¬
dency. Gould’s promise to Eldridge of aid for the Boston as a
consideration for Eldridge’s aid to Gould was promptly carried
out by the new Erie board. On October 8, the Erie executed a
contract to guarantee interest of $4,000,000 on the Boston’s
bonds. The Boston agreed that by January, 1870, it would pro¬
vide equipment sufficient to carry 300,000 tons of coal annually,
and to set aside with the trustees for the bondholders revenue
from the movement of coal sufficient to pay the interest on the
bonds guaranteed by the Erie.1
Within a month following the election of the new board,
Vanderbilt moved to exercise the power which he thought he
had over the Erie directorate. In order to avoid a rate war be¬
tween the Erie and the New York Central, Vanderbilt proposed
a pool. Conferences were held, but due to the objections raised
by the Erie, the proposal failed. The Erie contended that in the
pool the New York Central wanted too much and offered too
little.
Vanderbilt now perceived that he had made an error in per¬
mitting Drew to remain on the Erie board. He did not, how¬
ever, see that his real opponent was not Drew but Gould. Failing
to carry out his idea of a pool, Vanderbilt, resorting to the same
policy which he had so successfully used with the Harlem and
the Hudson River, decided to buy control of the Erie stock in

######PAGE 0044 OCR'D TEXT#######
40 Jay Gould
the open market. His operations were secret. Nothing is known
of the number of shares he had when in November, 1867, the
negotiations for the formation of a pool collapsed, nor of the
number of shares he bought from November, 1867, to February.,
1868.
While Vanderbilt was thus busy with his plans to buy control
of the Erie, the latter began a program of western expansion. In
February, 1868, the Erie, forestalling Vanderbilt, reached an
agreement with the Michigan Southern & Northern Indiana 2 to
build a line to Chicago.3 This new route would cut off the New
York Central’s lake shore route. Much of the traffic formerly
moving over the New York Central would now move over the
Erie; indeed some of the Michigan Southern’s stockholders esti¬
mated that the new route would quadruple the interchange
business of the road with the Erie and the Atlantic.4
This proposed arrangement stirred Vanderbilt to action. His
experience had taught him that it was sound judgment to capture
the enemy, and he decided therefore to take no chances. He
would capture the Erie. In February he ordered his representative
on the Erie directorate, Frank Work, to write to a leading direc¬
tor of the Michigan Southern to protest the proposed agreement
with the Erie.5 Fie then sent Work to the court of Judge Barnard
to apply, in this and in later court appearances, for a series of
injunctions. He wanted Drew enjoined from selling any more
stock or convertible bonds and to return the Erie stock that he
had sold in connection with his short-selling operations in the
summer of 1866.6 The complaisant judge granted all these re¬
quests. The court appearance of Work precipitated a sharp rise
in Erie. Vanderbilt aimed the injunctions directly at Drew and
the Erie board. He overlooked Gould and his creature—the ex¬
ecutive committee. The committee had power to act between
the dates of the board meetings, and it was therefore the com¬
mittee, and not the board, that carried out the broad decisions of
corporate policy.
The committee ignored the injunctions and recommended to
the board that it be authorized to borrow in order to improve the
road.7 The board then authorized the committee to borrow such
sums as might be necessary and the president and secretary “to
execute all needful and proper agreements and undertakings for

######PAGE 0045 OCR'D TEXT#######

such purpose.” 8 An elaborate statement by operating officers,
explaining the need for improvements, served to justify the
board’s action.
The Erie apparently had arranged to sell bonds for the purpose
of financing improvements. Appearances however were decep¬
tive. Gould and his associates on the executive committee were
engaged in stock market operations, and were selling Erie stock
short. Vanderbilt on the other hand was buying. Since the bonds
were convertible into stock, the sale of the bonds was only a de¬
ferred sale of the stock. It would have been simpler to sell the
stock direct, but this method was possible only if the consent
of two-thirds of the outstanding stock was secured. Since it was
necessary to get an immediate supply of stock, such a course was
not possible.
The sale of convertible bonds was, therefore, the only solu¬
tion. The issue of bonds convertible into stock had been au¬
thorized by a state law of 1851, and many roads including the
Erie had issued such bonds. On the very day that the board
authorized the committee to issue the bonds, the committee
authorized the treasurer to sell them and the treasurer shortly
thereafter sold $5,000,000 to a broker, with Drew guaranteeing
him against loss. The bonds were converted into stock, and the
stock sold in the open market. Tire market in the Erie was active
and strong, and Vanderbilt, confident of his strength, had issued
orders to buy all the stock offered. The outpouring of this new
block of 50,000 shares in a wild market, far from depressing its
price, was followed by a rise.9 There still remained $5,000,000 of
Erie bonds authorized but unissued. On March 7 the treasurer
sold the bonds and on the same day they were converted into
50,000 shares. Four days before, the court had enjoined Drew
from selling Erie stock until he had returned 50,000 shares to the
Erie treasury, and the Erie board from the issue of convertible
bonds or stock. The tenth day of March was named as the day
for a hearing before Judge Barnard. By that day, however, the
50,000 shares of Erie had already been delivered to the purchas¬
ers. Gould, Drew and associates had taken elaborate measures
to appear obedient to the court injunction.10
Regardless of injunctions, the second block of Erie was suc¬
cessfully floated. When this second wave of stock struck the

######PAGE 0046 OCR'D TEXT#######
42 Jay Gould
market, Vanderbilt was not so confident as he had been a few
weeks before. Though the price of Erie momentarily dropped to
71, it soon rallied on the same day, March 9, and closed at 78.
Before the end of the week, however, the price again dropped
to 671/2.
The sale of this second block of stock in violation of the court
injunction was followed by some weird incidents. Vanderbilt,
recognizing that the court injunction had been ignored and that
he had been tricked, applied for a contempt order. Gathering
hastily the corporate records, the books of account, and especially
the cash proceeds of the sales of r00,000 shares of Erie stock, the
Erie officials sped across the river in a ferryboat and moved the
corporate offices to Jersey City. To say that the problems facing
both contestants—Vanderbilt in New York and Gould and Drew
in Jersey City—were novel and unprecedented, is to put the situa¬
tion mildly. Vanderbilt’s position was critical. His fortune con¬
sisted largely of the stocks of the New York Central and the Har¬
lem, and the market for the latter stock was narrow. Since the
corner of 1864 trading in Harlem shares was light, in an emer¬
gency only a few shares could be liquidated. It is probable that
the market for New York Central stock would not have absorbed
large sales. The trading and investment community was well
aware of Vanderbilt’s personal condition. Knowing that Vander¬
bilt had a large supply of New York Central, investors would
not buy the stock except at reduced prices.
Vanderbilt had invested about $10,000,000 in Erie stock.
Much of this stock he bought on credit, the loans being in large
part secured by Erie stock. The Erie shares soon became partly
unacceptable for collateral purposes,11 and a number of stock¬
brokers failed. If the banks had eliminated the Erie stock from
Vanderbilt’s collateral, serious consequences might have ensued,
and to save himself it might have been necessary for Vanderbilt
to sell his New York Central and Harlem stocks. Such action
would have produced a market crash and might have impaired
Vanderbilt’s personal fortune.
Had Vanderbilt flinched, had he been unable or unwilling to
hold the price of Erie firm at or above 70; had he permitted its
price to drop to its intrinsic value, probably about 50,12 the dis¬
aster to him might have been irreparable. Vanderbilt did not

retreat. The price of Erie was held at 70, and after the initial
market shock in March and April, the prices of New York Cen¬
tral and the Harlem were also stabilized.
On the other side of the river in Jersey City the position of
Gould, Drew and their associates was equally critical. They had
violated an injunction and were in contempt of court. They
could not appear in the State of New York to carry on the busi¬
ness of the Erie. The company had issued and sold 100,000 shares
of stock illegally. A New York court had appointed a receiver for
the proceeds of the sale of this stock, and a conflict between the
management in Jersey City and the receiver in New York might
make it difficult to operate the property. Though the company
was incorporated in New York it could not perform its functions
in that state. Its offices were located in New Jersey but it was not
incorporated there. This was a defect; but it did not last long.
Gould let it be known that the Erie had come to stay. Its exist¬
ence in Jersey City would be a boon; it would bring in funds and
increase the prosperity of both the city and the state. Within
less than three weeks these arguments produced their effect. A
law was rushed through the New Jersey Legislature and signed
by the governor, making the Erie a corporation of New Jersey.13
Although the company could now legally do business in New
Jersey, it was evident to Gould that its real place of business was
in New York City. Since neither he nor any official of the com¬
pany could return to that community without being taken into
court and perhaps sent to jail, it was necessary to negotiate with
Vanderbilt. Although Gould recognized that he could do little
with Vanderbilt, he concluded realistically that he could do
much with the New York State Legislature. In that body a bill
was introduced to legalize the issue of convertible bonds. Van¬
derbilt opposed the bill and his representatives appeared in Al¬
bany to object to its passage. The bill was defeated in the lower
house, and public-spirited citizens were relieved. The majesty of
the law had been asserted and it was believed that the conspira¬
tors would be punished.14 Gould, however, rose to the occasion.
Appreciating his danger if the bill were lost, he appeared in Al¬
bany three days after its defeat in the lower house. There he was
arrested and brought before Judge Barnard in New York City.
He was then released on bail and after several contacts with the

######PAGE 0048 OCR'D TEXT#######
44 JayGould
officers of the law, succeeded in getting sufficient time to com¬
plete his work with the New York State Legislature. He had with
him a bag full of Erie money. Addressing himself to the efficient
expenditure of this money among members of the State Legisla¬
ture, he made certain that greenbacks flew thick and fast. Pre¬
cisely how much he spent is not known, the estimates ranging
from $300,000 15 to $1,000,000.16 Gould himself when asked five
years later how much money he had spent to influence legislative
or election activities, replied, picturesquely, "You might as well
go back and ask me how many cars of freight were moved on a
particular day.” 17
Whatever the cost, his success was unquestioned. The bill
which had been lost in the lower house was amended, passed
by both houses, and on April first signed by the governor. The
law made it illegal for the Erie to use any money realized from
the sale of convertible bonds, "except for the purpose of com¬
pleting, furthering, and operating its railroad, and for no other
purpose.” 18 The issue of bonds and their conversion into stock,
against which the injunctions had thundered, was now legal,
providing, of course, that the money was used for specified pur¬
poses. Looking ahead to the perpetuation of his personal control
of the road, and to anticipate further stock market forays by Van¬
derbilt, Gould succeeded also in inserting into the law a pro¬
vision which forbade interlocking directors between the Harlem,
the Hudson River, the New York Central and the Erie, and an¬
other clause forbidding any consolidation or pooling between the
Erie and these lines.
This bill weakened Vanderbilt’s trading position. Since he
could not use the stock to control the policies of the Erie, he was
no longer interested in holding any. He was therefore ready to
trade with his opponents, and soon withdrew his suits. The way
was thus laid for a settlement between the two contestants. The
negotiations were lengthy. Drew was simple enough to assume
that Vanderbilt’s stock could be bought out only by using his
own funds. Gould, however, had a richer imagination and a more
comprehensive view of strategic possibilities. Though he had
neither the funds nor the credit of Drew, he did have that quality
which was then more important than either of these virtues. He
had an understanding of the possibilities of corporation finance.

######PAGE 0049 OCR'D TEXT#######
Gould Acquires the Erie 45
He knew that if he did not have adequate funds or credit, the Erie
did, and that with the use of the Erie’s assets, he could afford to
make a proposal which would be more satisfactory both to Van¬
derbilt and Eldridge, to say nothing of himself.
A settlement was finally made in July, 1868, and Vanderbilt
was amply provided for. Gould on behalf of the Erie agreed to
purchase $5,000,000 par of Erie stock at $70 per share; payable
$2,500,000 in cash and $1,250,000 par value in Boston bonds
(guaranteed by the Erie) at 80. The Erie also paid Vanderbilt a
bonus of $1,000,000 to induce him to withdraw the suits against
the Erie, and Drew et al. Richard Schell, a relative of Vander¬
bilt’s, and Frank Work, Vanderbilt’s agent on the Erie board,
had lost some money in speculating in Erie stock, and in order
to reimburse them, the Erie agreed to pay them $429,000 in cash.
During the course of the proceedings against the Erie in Febru¬
ary and March, Peter B. Sweeny, high in the councils of Tam¬
many Hall, had acted for a short time, under one of the numerous
court orders, as a receiver for the Erie. “There had been nothing
for a Receiver to receive, and as a balm for his not having had a
chance at the Erie treasury,” 19 the Erie paid Sweeny $150,000.20
In this settlement which Gould and Fisk later described as a
“corrupt agreement,” 21 Vanderbilt was given the opportunity to
sell part of his Erie holdings. Gould, after having done most of
the work in preparing the background for the settlement, was
apparently overlooked—but only apparently. In the settlement
he received the Erie. Vanderbilt elected two of his representa¬
tives, beneficiaries of the Erie settlement—Work and Schell—to
the Erie board; while Gould and Fisk appointed themselves to
serve on the Erie executive committee. Drew resigned and Gould
and Fisk together with F. A. Lane, of Erie counsel, controlled the
executive committee.
In the eyes of the law this arrangement had little significance.
The directors were to be legally elected by the stockholders at
their annual meeting, which would not be held until October. It
would seem that Eldridge, the president of the Erie, might have
had something to say about the Vanderbilt settlement. Eldridge’s
primary interest however was the Boston. No sooner did Gould
settle with Vanderbilt than he made another settlement with

######PAGE 0050 OCR'D TEXT#######
46 /ay Gould
Eldridge. The Erie agreed to buy $5,000,000 of the Boston bonds
at 80 if he would resign as president, and Eldridge accepted.
The Vanderbilt and Eldridge agreements required the Erie to
raise approximately $9,000,000, as follows:
1. For 50,000 shares of Erie purchased from Vanderbilt at 70 .. $3,500,000
2. For bonus to Vanderbilt . 1,000,000
3. For compensation to Schell and Work . 429,000
4. For “balm” to Sweeny . 150,000
5. For purchase of $5,000,000 B.H.&E. bonds at 80 . 4,000,000
$9,079,000
Gould well understood that the company which assumed this
new burden was in fact, if not in law, a bankrupt. The Erie could
not pay its floating debt. Its property was in poor physical con¬
dition, and to the already heavy fixed charges it had added the
interest on the guaranteed bonds of the Boston—an incompleted
road which had slight prospect of earning much to meet its in¬
terest. The Erie, however, under Gould’s leadership, during the
following nine months met all these obligations and in addition
entered upon a large expansion program.
Gould’s first step was the sale at a loss of Erie stock and the
Boston bonds just purchased from Vanderbilt and Eldridge.
Gould meanwhile faced an important personal problem. He was
president, not by grace of shareholders’ votes, but by an extra-
legal proceeding. Not until October could he be legally elected
president. The campaign to insure his success was carefully pre¬
pared. Under the legal covering of a change in the by-laws, he
announced on behalf of the executive committee, that the
transfer books would be closed fifteen days earlier than in 1867.22
This action prevented a number of stockholders from casting
their votes. To make the prohibition against voting by other
stockholders even stronger, he secured a by-law to make it illegal
to cast any votes by proxy. Although the anti-Gould stockholders
had not yet awakened to the situation, Gould took no chances.
He now took a further step. Trading upon the carelessness of
the stockholders, he not only prevented those stockholders from
voting who were unable to attend the meeting in person, but he
also proposed to vote their stock himself. A large number of
shares were held by foreign stockholders, many of whom had not
taken the trouble to transfer the shares to their names. When

######PAGE 0051 OCR'D TEXT#######
Gould Acquires the Erie 47
Gould, Drew and associates in March, 1868, converted the bonds
into shares, they transferred the stock on the books of the com¬
pany to the names of two brokers. When investors bought the
stock, they did not transfer the stock to their own names. A
power of attorney gave them title to the property. Gould voted
all these shares in favor of his ticket.
By these devices, Gould, despite his small holdings of the com¬
pany’s stock, was able to control the election. To strengthen fur¬
ther his hold upon the company’s management, his eye fell upon
the Tammany politicians. The head of the Tammany ring was
the notorious William Tweed, who had originally opposed Gould.
Gould had previously approached Tweed to induce him to pre¬
vail upon Judge Barnard to issue an injunction, but Tweed had
refused. When he was informed, however, the day following his
refusal that he could make some money for himself, Tweed
agreed, and thereupon asked Judge Barnard, as an act of friend¬
ship to him, to issue the desired injunction.23 Tweed later re¬
ceived, apparently without any cash consideration, a block of
Erie stock.24 Tweed, together with Sweeny, his political ally, were
elected to the Erie’s board in October as part of the Gould slate.
By elevating Tweed to the Erie board, Gould also secured the
Support of Judge Barnard. Barnard, who had supplied injunctions
at Vanderbilt’s request, would now supply injunctions at Gould’s
request.
By these means Gould and his allies were elected to the Erie
board by a substantial majority. Gould was legally elected presi¬
dent, and Fisk, his coarse mouthpiece, was made a member of
the board. Gould also controlled the executive committee, which
was the governing body between board meetings, and Gould saw
to it that there were few such meetings.
In the space of one year Gould had defeated Vanderbilt, the
country’s leading railroad man, and Drew, the country’s leading
railroad speculator. He had acquired full control of the Erie, one
of the major eastern trunk lines, and had revealed to Vanderbilt
clearly for the first time the identity of his railroad antagonist.
Even though master of the company’s destinies, Gould had
not yet solved its financial problems. His first task was to raise
additional funds to keep the Erie afloat, to meet its operating
expenses and to pay its floating debt. In view of the company’s

######PAGE 0052 OCR'D TEXT#######
48 /ay Gould
financial condition he could find no market for its securities
through established banking channels. There was, however, al¬
ways a speculative market for Erie stock. There may have been
no earnings but there were hopes. Though the road could not
sell the stock without approval of two-thirds of the stockholders,
Gould, in charge of its affairs, could continue to sell convertible
bonds. The executive committee had full liberty of action, and
Gould dominated the committee. On August 5, 1868, the com¬
mittee authorized the president to sell $20,000,000 of convertible
bonds at prices and on terms he thought best. Between October
16 and 24, after the stockholders had elected Gould to the presi¬
dency, the company issued the bonds. They were promptly con¬
verted into stock and the stock sold at about 40, its current mar¬
ket price. According to Gould, the bonds were sold quietly by
H. N. Smith of the brokerage firm of Smith, Gould & Martin.25
Even before these Erie securities were sold, and before Gould
was elected president, he was already laying plans for a stock-
market foray based upon another idea. He decided to exploit the
strategic weakness of the national banking system. Bank reserves
consisted of specie and legal tender, both of which were in short
supply. The locking up of greenbacks for the purpose of reducing
the supply of lendable funds for speculative purposes had been
tried a number of times. Withdrawal of legal tender from circu¬
lation could be most effective in the fall months. At that time
funds were normally withdrawn from New York City to the
West to finance the fall movement of crops. The supply of money
was thereby reduced and the price of current funds increased.
Early in September, 1868, the supply of money appeared to be
excessive. Any attempt to produce a financial crisis by with¬
drawing legal tender and thus accelerate a deflation, was likely,
in the opinion of a critic just beginning its persistent quarter-of-
a-century attack on Gould, to be temporary and the effect doubt¬
ful.26
During these weeks Gould and his group were selling the Erie
shares which the road had purchased from Vanderbilt, and in
addition borrowed more shares to sell short for their own ac¬
counts. The price of Erie, despite the rise in the general market,
was down substantially from early July.
The money market, as well as the stock market, puzzled in-

######PAGE 0053 OCR'D TEXT#######
Gould Acquires the Erie qq
formed financial observers, who believed that money would con¬
tinue easy. In the first week of October, however, money rates
suddenly rose to y per cent. Monetary analysts now first recog¬
nized the fact that securities and national bank notes were being
used to borrow funds. The proceeds of loans were taken in legal
tender, withdrawn from the market and locked up by the bor¬
rower. And the borrower was Gould. The collateral for the loans
consisted of property owned partly by Gould and partly by the
Erie.
The stock market, however, was not convinced, and for the
first three weeks in October prices advanced. Erie rose, too, fluc¬
tuating between 47Vi and 50; thereafter, from October 20, Erie
declined persistently. Rumors spread that the Erie had resumed
the issue of convertible bonds, and the stock exchange appointed
a committee to investigate. This action suited Gould’s purpose
well. He could now excite fear and stimulate further sales of Erie.
He therefore informed the committee that since the end of the
Vanderbilt litigation the road had authorized the issue of $10,-
000,000 additional convertible bonds, $5,000,000 of which had
already been converted into stock. It would furthermore re¬
quire strong efforts, he said, to prevent a default on the payment
of Erie’s acceptances due January first.27 Tire Erie continued to
drop and on October 30 the price reached 3 514. A few days later
the selling spread to other securities but Erie remained steady. By
the end of the month the truth was revealed. Gould and his
group had withdrawn from $12,000,000 to $15,000,000 of legal
tender.
The general stock market by this time was demoralized. Wheat
dropped twenty-five cents a bushel, and cotton from three to four
cents a pound. Government bonds declined 4 per cent in two
days, and money rates soared from 7 per cent to 50 per cent, and
then to 150 per cent. Gould in a few weeks had thus precipitated
"the greatest difficulty which [had] presented itself in the com¬
mercial community in regulating the operation of the finances
since the organization of the banking system.” 28
In the midst of this panic selling and shortly before Erie
reached its record low, Drew entered the market. As a trader in
Erie stock he was now an outsider. He had had little experience
with Gould and, taking his public statements at their face value.

######PAGE 0054 OCR'D TEXT#######

sold 70,000 shares of Erie short at prices not much higher than
40. Large blocks of English-held Erie stocks were also sold. Since
it took some time to mail the stock from England, the English
shareholders were technically short of the market. In accordance
with the rules of the Exchange, they were required to make im¬
mediate delivery. They therefore borrowed Erie shares, the loan to
be repaid when the stocks arrived. This steady selling by the
general trading public, by Drew, and by English sources did not,
however, depress Erie any further. Yet pessimism was widespread
and money tight.
All this was classical background for the execution of a typical
Gould market climax. The funereal Friday gloom was followed
by a Saturday financial blessing, for on that morning Erie sud¬
denly shot upward from 36% to 52V2. On Monday, Erie, “amid
one of the wildest scenes ever witnessed on the Stock Exchange,
was run up to 61 in half an hour,” 29 wrote the chronicler of the
Erie’s history, and the monetary stringency suddenly eased.
Gould had closed the trap and Drew was cornered. A man of
affairs, long experienced in the intricacies of trading, Drew imme¬
diately recognized his danger. Against Gould, however, he was
an amateur. Drew had heavy paper losses, and again, as in the
Harlem corner a few years before, he refused to abide by his con¬
tracts and threatened suit. He asked Gould and Fisk to sell him
the Erie stock necessary to deliver under his short contracts. If
Gould did not have the stock, Drew insisted, he (Gould) could
easily manufacture a supply through the now normal method of
issuing convertible bonds.30
Gould did not relent and made no concessions to Drew. On
the contrary, he picked up valuable information from him. Drew
had been in touch with a representative of some English Erie
stockholders represented in this country by August Belmont &
Co—a firm which had decided to bring suit against Gould and
his associates. The day before their attorneys were to appear in
court, Drew met Fisk and Gould privately. Unless he was given
some stock to fulfill his engagements, Drew warned them, he
would go over to the opposition.
Gould now had inside information. He knew that on Monday
morning, November 16, Drew and English stockholders would
begin judicial proceedings. On that day the Belmont counsel

appeared before Judge Sutherland and asked for an injunction to
restrain the Erie directors from issuing new stock or removing
the company’s funds beyond the jurisdiction of the court. The
judge was asked to prevent Gould from doing in November what
he had so successfully done in March. The court was also asked
to appoint a receiver. Both petitions were granted.
Gould, however, taking advantage of the information Drew
had imparted to him the day before, had anticipated the Bel¬
mont suit. As soon as Drew left, Gould ordered an Erie ferry
superintendent to appear before Gould’s new ally, Judge Barnard,
early Monday morning and apply for a receiver. The revelations
of the applicant probably did not surprise the judge, who imme¬
diately appointed a receiver, and the receiver was none other
than Gould himself. Barnard on request also enjoined the parties
in the Belmont suit from proceeding under their injunction.
Gould had created a complicated situation. The Erie had two
receivers and was subjected to two sets of judicial injunctions.
Delay was inevitable, a condition agreeable to Gould but not to
Drew. Drew wanted some stock to settle his short contracts, but
Gould’s strategy frustrated his hopes.
Gould’s ability in handling these complicated financial-legal
problems was finally beginning to be recognized. In the accounts
of the Erie incidents that had appeared in legal and lay periodicals,
the writers described the work of Drew and Vanderbilt but
scarcely mentioned Gould.31 His discomfiting of Drew, however,
brought him squarely to the forefront. His strategy in anticipat¬
ing Belmont and Drew in the battle of judicial injunctions, in
the opinion of a New York financial writer, exhibited "the pres¬
ence of the master mind which [had] planned and carried out all
the magnificent schemes connected with the speculation in Erie.
However questionable these schemes, . . . their skill and success
[exhibited] Napoleonic genius on the part of him who conceived
them.”32
Gould’s strategy, however, was not yet fully unfolded. Two
days after he had been appointed receiver, he appeared before
Judge Barnard to relate that the Belmont counsel had raised
some questions about the legality of the Erie stock issue. He
wanted above all to make the stock legal, and therefore proposed
that the court authorize the repurchase of this stock with com-

######PAGE 0056 OCR'D TEXT#######

pany funds at prices less than par. The request was promptly
granted. The judge thus authorized the use of Erie s money to
repurchase stock at prices up to $100 a share, sold less than two
months before at about $40 a share.
Even this was not the end. Gould moved swiftly from court to
court, and soon discovered a federal judge—Blatchford—to serve
as the vehicle for the issue of another extraordinary order. Upon
application of a small stockholder, he appointed a receiver to
administer the $8,000,000 of funds allegedly received by Erie
from the sale in October of 200,000 shares of stock, and that re¬
ceiver again was Gould. It is unnecessary to trace in detail the
twists and turns of these judicial proceedings, as they are not
relevant to the main issue. The point is that Drew did not get
the Erie shares. Instead, he settled with Gould at about 57 or 58.
Thereafter the price dropped to about 40 and Drew lost over
$i,ooo,ooo.33
It is clear that Gould had impaired the value of the Erie stock.
The stockholders were worse off than they were a year before
Gould’s acquisition of control. More than 300,000 shares of the
Erie had been issued, and, except for some minor improvements
and the $5,000,000 of Boston’s bonds which were soon to pass
their interest, the Erie treasury had nothing to show. Gould nev¬
ertheless succeeded in making a case for himself. In December,
just before he turned to a series of new adventures, he issued an
optimistic statement to the company’s shareholders. The Erie,
he said, had done many notable things: it had built a twenty-
mile extension between Buffalo and Suspension Bridge to con¬
nect with other lines, from which it would get an increased an¬
nual gross business of from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000, it had built
a short line between New York and Newburgh on the Hudson,
and it had made a profitable contract with the United States Ex¬
press Company increasing the compensation of the Erie. The
executive committee had also directed the president to sue Van¬
derbilt to recover the $1,000,000 commission paid him in the
July settlement and to force him to buy back $5,000,000 par of
Erie stock for $3,500,000. Suits had already been begun against
Drew to compel him to account to the Erie for about $1,000,000
of profits made from his lake steamships.
"Whenever the facts are fully known and the public becomes

aware of what is being done to make the Erie Railway the most
magnificent and perfect railway line in the country and the pride
of the City and State,” declared Gould, "then the acts of the
present managers will be appreciated.” 34 Although the facts in
the statement were correct, they were nevertheless facts which
were carefully selected. The average stockholder, uninformed of
business and economic backgrounds, had neither the experience
nor the training to discriminate between important and unim¬
portant matters. Although the facts presented by Gould were
accurate, they did not embody the truth. The few improvements
to which he referred represented an insubstantial investment
compared with the millions which had been raised through stock
issues and largely lost almost immediately thereafter; while fur¬
ther funds were lost through stock speculations of Gould, Drew,
Fisk, Vanderbilt, Work, Schell, and others.
There was little doubt, however, that the public statement
made by Gould in December was satisfactory to many sharehold¬
ers. Gould had taken over a weak property; he was introducing
improvements and would soon make the property profitable.
Within the next few weeks he made an equally satisfactory im¬
pression upon representatives of the public interest. A state legis¬
lative committee, appalled at the outpouring of securities by the
Erie, as well as by the Vanderbilt lines, made an investigation.
Gould appearing as a witness proved to be "the most intelligent
and thoroughly posted witness the committee have had before
them.” 35 Despite his multitude of speculations, his violations of
court injunctions, his buying of judges and legislators, and his
manipulation of the country’s banking system, Gould was recog¬
nized as an able, well-informed, and intelligent business leader.
He had severe critics but he also had loyal admirers. Still in his
early thirties, he was a factor not to be ignored.

# Chapter III - Gould Acquires the Erie

Elected to the Erie board in October, 1867, Gould seemed to have no important role. To the public, to the railroad managers, and to speculators and investors he was unknown. Although for the previous eight years he had been a stockbroker, he had done little in the financial district to attract public attention. If he had been successful as a stock speculator, that fact could have been known only to his intimate associates. On the Erie he appeared to represent himself only.

Three groups struggled for control of the board. One was led by Eldridge, who was interested in the Erie only as a means of safeguarding his substantial investment in the Boston. Another was represented by Drew, who at that time had little Erie stock, and a third by Vanderbilt. Although Vanderbilt had been a railroad investor for more than a decade, it was only within the previous five years that he had become a railroad operator. His success in the short period was phenomenal. The Hudson River Railroad and the Harlem had been competitors. Prior to their acquisition by Vanderbilt, their properties had been in poor physical condition, and neither had an earnings record to qualify their securities as investments. By 1864 Vanderbilt, partly by a number of stock market deals, including the famous Harlem corner, had acquired control of both roads. The rise in stock values was spectacular. In 1867 he also secured control of the New York Central, operating a line from Albany to Buffalo.

With these three properties under his management, he had a through line from New York City to Buffalo. He then decided to acquire the Erie and secure control of all the main lines entering New York City from the west. Vanderbilt appeared confident of his position. Since Drew owed his position on the Erie board to Vanderbilt, he was presumably his friend. There was no reason why Eldridge, as president of the Erie, should oppose Vanderbilt. Neither did Vanderbilt recognize any danger from Gould. He knew of Gould only as a stock speculator and believed that he was on the board only to aid his speculations in Erie stock.

Gould, however, unknown to Vanderbilt had already entered into close business relations with both Drew and Eldridge. With Drew he had concluded a joint trading account. And in order to increase his importance as a trader, he had also become a partner in a stock-brokerage house in which Henry N. Smith, a wealthy speculator, was the dominant personality. After Gould's entrance into this firm, its name was changed to Smith, Gould & Martin.

Gould's relations with Eldridge were even closer. Although the facts are not clear, the conclusion is nevertheless suggested that Gould's purchase of Erie proxies with funds advanced by Eldridge was responsible for the latter's elevation to the Erie presidency. Gould's promise to Eldridge of aid for the Boston as a consideration for Eldridge's aid to Gould was promptly carried out by the new Erie board. On October 8, the Erie executed a contract to guarantee interest of $4,000,000 on the Boston's bonds. The Boston agreed that by January, 1870, it would provide equipment sufficient to carry 300,000 tons of coal annually, and to set aside with the trustees for the bondholders revenue from the movement of coal sufficient to pay the interest on the bonds guaranteed by the Erie.[^1]

Within a month following the election of the new board, Vanderbilt moved to exercise the power which he thought he had over the Erie directorate. In order to avoid a rate war between the Erie and the New York Central, Vanderbilt proposed a pool. Conferences were held, but due to the objections raised by the Erie, the proposal failed. The Erie contended that in the pool the New York Central wanted too much and offered too little.

Vanderbilt now perceived that he had made an error in permitting Drew to remain on the Erie board. He did not, however, see that his real opponent was not Drew but Gould. Failing to carry out his idea of a pool, Vanderbilt, resorting to the same policy which he had so successfully used with the Harlem and the Hudson River, decided to buy control of the Erie stock in the open market. His operations were secret. Nothing is known of the number of shares he had when in November, 1867, the negotiations for the formation of a pool collapsed, nor of the number of shares he bought from November, 1867, to February, 1868.

While Vanderbilt was thus busy with his plans to buy control of the Erie, the latter began a program of western expansion. In February, 1868, the Erie, forestalling Vanderbilt, reached an agreement with the Michigan Southern & Northern Indiana[^2] to build a line to Chicago.[^3] This new route would cut off the New York Central's lake shore route. Much of the traffic formerly moving over the New York Central would now move over the Erie; indeed some of the Michigan Southern's stockholders estimated that the new route would quadruple the interchange business of the road with the Erie and the Atlantic.[^4]

This proposed arrangement stirred Vanderbilt to action. His experience had taught him that it was sound judgment to capture the enemy, and he decided therefore to take no chances. He would capture the Erie. In February he ordered his representative on the Erie directorate, Frank Work, to write to a leading director of the Michigan Southern to protest the proposed agreement with the Erie.[^5] He then sent Work to the court of Judge Barnard to apply, in this and in later court appearances, for a series of injunctions. He wanted Drew enjoined from selling any more stock or convertible bonds and to return the Erie stock that he had sold in connection with his short-selling operations in the summer of 1866.[^6] The complaisant judge granted all these requests. The court appearance of Work precipitated a sharp rise in Erie. Vanderbilt aimed the injunctions directly at Drew and the Erie board. He overlooked Gould and his creature—the executive committee. The committee had power to act between the dates of the board meetings, and it was therefore the committee, and not the board, that carried out the broad decisions of corporate policy.

The committee ignored the injunctions and recommended to the board that it be authorized to borrow in order to improve the road.[^7] The board then authorized the committee to borrow such sums as might be necessary and the president and secretary "to execute all needful and proper agreements and undertakings for such purpose."[^8] An elaborate statement by operating officers, explaining the need for improvements, served to justify the board's action.

The Erie apparently had arranged to sell bonds for the purpose of financing improvements. Appearances however were deceptive. Gould and his associates on the executive committee were engaged in stock market operations, and were selling Erie stock short. Vanderbilt on the other hand was buying. Since the bonds were convertible into stock, the sale of the bonds was only a deferred sale of the stock. It would have been simpler to sell the stock direct, but this method was possible only if the consent of two-thirds of the outstanding stock was secured. Since it was necessary to get an immediate supply of stock, such a course was not possible.

The sale of convertible bonds was, therefore, the only solution. The issue of bonds convertible into stock had been authorized by a state law of 1851, and many roads including the Erie had issued such bonds. On the very day that the board authorized the committee to issue the bonds, the committee authorized the treasurer to sell them and the treasurer shortly thereafter sold $5,000,000 to a broker, with Drew guaranteeing him against loss. The bonds were converted into stock, and the stock sold in the open market. The market in the Erie was active and strong, and Vanderbilt, confident of his strength, had issued orders to buy all the stock offered. The outpouring of this new block of 50,000 shares in a wild market, far from depressing its price, was followed by a rise.[^9] There still remained $5,000,000 of Erie bonds authorized but unissued. On March 7 the treasurer sold the bonds and on the same day they were converted into 50,000 shares. Four days before, the court had enjoined Drew from selling Erie stock until he had returned 50,000 shares to the Erie treasury, and the Erie board from the issue of convertible bonds or stock. The tenth day of March was named as the day for a hearing before Judge Barnard. By that day, however, the 50,000 shares of Erie had already been delivered to the purchasers. Gould, Drew and associates had taken elaborate measures to appear obedient to the court injunction.[^10]

Regardless of injunctions, the second block of Erie was successfully floated. When this second wave of stock struck the market, Vanderbilt was not so confident as he had been a few weeks before. Though the price of Erie momentarily dropped to 71, it soon rallied on the same day, March 9, and closed at 78. Before the end of the week, however, the price again dropped to 67½.

The sale of this second block of stock in violation of the court injunction was followed by some weird incidents. Vanderbilt, recognizing that the court injunction had been ignored and that he had been tricked, applied for a contempt order. Gathering hastily the corporate records, the books of account, and especially the cash proceeds of the sales of 100,000 shares of Erie stock, the Erie officials sped across the river in a ferryboat and moved the corporate offices to Jersey City. To say that the problems facing both contestants—Vanderbilt in New York and Gould and Drew in Jersey City—were novel and unprecedented, is to put the situation mildly. Vanderbilt's position was critical. His fortune consisted largely of the stocks of the New York Central and the Harlem, and the market for the latter stock was narrow. Since the corner of 1864 trading in Harlem shares was light, in an emergency only a few shares could be liquidated. It is probable that the market for New York Central stock would not have absorbed large sales. The trading and investment community was well aware of Vanderbilt's personal condition. Knowing that Vanderbilt had a large supply of New York Central, investors would not buy the stock except at reduced prices.

Vanderbilt had invested about $10,000,000 in Erie stock. Much of this stock he bought on credit, the loans being in large part secured by Erie stock. The Erie shares soon became partly unacceptable for collateral purposes,[^11] and a number of stockbrokers failed. If the banks had eliminated the Erie stock from Vanderbilt's collateral, serious consequences might have ensued, and to save himself it might have been necessary for Vanderbilt to sell his New York Central and Harlem stocks. Such action would have produced a market crash and might have impaired Vanderbilt's personal fortune.

Had Vanderbilt flinched, had he been unable or unwilling to hold the price of Erie firm at or above 70; had he permitted its price to drop to its intrinsic value, probably about 50,[^12] the disaster to him might have been irreparable. Vanderbilt did not retreat. The price of Erie was held at 70, and after the initial market shock in March and April, the prices of New York Central and the Harlem were also stabilized.

On the other side of the river in Jersey City the position of Gould, Drew and their associates was equally critical. They had violated an injunction and were in contempt of court. They could not appear in the State of New York to carry on the business of the Erie. The company had issued and sold 100,000 shares of stock illegally. A New York court had appointed a receiver for the proceeds of the sale of this stock, and a conflict between the management in Jersey City and the receiver in New York might make it difficult to operate the property. Though the company was incorporated in New York it could not perform its functions in that state. Its offices were located in New Jersey but it was not incorporated there. This was a defect; but it did not last long. Gould let it be known that the Erie had come to stay. Its existence in Jersey City would be a boon; it would bring in funds and increase the prosperity of both the city and the state. Within less than three weeks these arguments produced their effect. A law was rushed through the New Jersey Legislature and signed by the governor, making the Erie a corporation of New Jersey.[^13]

Although the company could now legally do business in New Jersey, it was evident to Gould that its real place of business was in New York City. Since neither he nor any official of the company could return to that community without being taken into court and perhaps sent to jail, it was necessary to negotiate with Vanderbilt. Although Gould recognized that he could do little with Vanderbilt, he concluded realistically that he could do much with the New York State Legislature. In that body a bill was introduced to legalize the issue of convertible bonds. Vanderbilt opposed the bill and his representatives appeared in Albany to object to its passage. The bill was defeated in the lower house, and public-spirited citizens were relieved. The majesty of the law had been asserted and it was believed that the conspirators would be punished.[^14] Gould, however, rose to the occasion. Appreciating his danger if the bill were lost, he appeared in Albany three days after its defeat in the lower house. There he was arrested and brought before Judge Barnard in New York City. He was then released on bail and after several contacts with the officers of the law, succeeded in getting sufficient time to complete his work with the New York State Legislature. He had with him a bag full of Erie money. Addressing himself to the efficient expenditure of this money among members of the State Legislature, he made certain that greenbacks flew thick and fast. Precisely how much he spent is not known, the estimates ranging from $300,000[^15] to $1,000,000.[^16] Gould himself when asked five years later how much money he had spent to influence legislative or election activities, replied, picturesquely, "You might as well go back and ask me how many cars of freight were moved on a particular day."[^17]

Whatever the cost, his success was unquestioned. The bill which had been lost in the lower house was amended, passed by both houses, and on April first signed by the governor. The law made it illegal for the Erie to use any money realized from the sale of convertible bonds, "except for the purpose of completing, furthering, and operating its railroad, and for no other purpose."[^18] The issue of bonds and their conversion into stock, against which the injunctions had thundered, was now legal, providing, of course, that the money was used for specified purposes. Looking ahead to the perpetuation of his personal control of the road, and to anticipate further stock market forays by Vanderbilt, Gould succeeded also in inserting into the law a provision which forbade interlocking directors between the Harlem, the Hudson River, the New York Central and the Erie, and another clause forbidding any consolidation or pooling between the Erie and these lines.

This bill weakened Vanderbilt's trading position. Since he could not use the stock to control the policies of the Erie, he was no longer interested in holding any. He was therefore ready to trade with his opponents, and soon withdrew his suits. The way was thus laid for a settlement between the two contestants. The negotiations were lengthy. Drew was simple enough to assume that Vanderbilt's stock could be bought out only by using his own funds. Gould, however, had a richer imagination and a more comprehensive view of strategic possibilities. Though he had neither the funds nor the credit of Drew, he did have that quality which was then more important than either of these virtues. He had an understanding of the possibilities of corporation finance.

He knew that if he did not have adequate funds or credit, the Erie did, and that with the use of the Erie's assets, he could afford to make a proposal which would be more satisfactory both to Vanderbilt and Eldridge, to say nothing of himself.

A settlement was finally made in July, 1868, and Vanderbilt was amply provided for. Gould on behalf of the Erie agreed to purchase $5,000,000 par of Erie stock at $70 per share; payable $2,500,000 in cash and $1,250,000 par value in Boston bonds (guaranteed by the Erie) at 80. The Erie also paid Vanderbilt a bonus of $1,000,000 to induce him to withdraw the suits against the Erie, and Drew et al. Richard Schell, a relative of Vanderbilt's, and Frank Work, Vanderbilt's agent on the Erie board, had lost some money in speculating in Erie stock, and in order to reimburse them, the Erie agreed to pay them $429,000 in cash. During the course of the proceedings against the Erie in February and March, Peter B. Sweeny, high in the councils of Tammany Hall, had acted for a short time, under one of the numerous court orders, as a receiver for the Erie. "There had been nothing for a Receiver to receive, and as a balm for his not having had a chance at the Erie treasury,"[^19] the Erie paid Sweeny $150,000.[^20]

In this settlement which Gould and Fisk later described as a "corrupt agreement,"[^21] Vanderbilt was given the opportunity to sell part of his Erie holdings. Gould, after having done most of the work in preparing the background for the settlement, was apparently overlooked—but only apparently. In the settlement he received the Erie. Vanderbilt elected two of his representatives, beneficiaries of the Erie settlement—Work and Schell—to the Erie board; while Gould and Fisk appointed themselves to serve on the Erie executive committee. Drew resigned and Gould and Fisk together with F. A. Lane, of Erie counsel, controlled the executive committee.

In the eyes of the law this arrangement had little significance. The directors were to be legally elected by the stockholders at their annual meeting, which would not be held until October. It would seem that Eldridge, the president of the Erie, might have had something to say about the Vanderbilt settlement. Eldridge's primary interest however was the Boston. No sooner did Gould settle with Vanderbilt than he made another settlement with Eldridge. The Erie agreed to buy $5,000,000 of the Boston bonds at 80 if he would resign as president, and Eldridge accepted.

The Vanderbilt and Eldridge agreements required the Erie to raise approximately $9,000,000, as follows:

1. For 50,000 shares of Erie purchased from Vanderbilt at 70 .. $3,500,000
2. For bonus to Vanderbilt . 1,000,000
3. For compensation to Schell and Work . 429,000
4. For "balm" to Sweeny . 150,000
5. For purchase of $5,000,000 B.H.&E. bonds at 80 . 4,000,000
$9,079,000

Gould well understood that the company which assumed this new burden was in fact, if not in law, a bankrupt. The Erie could not pay its floating debt. Its property was in poor physical condition, and to the already heavy fixed charges it had added the interest on the guaranteed bonds of the Boston—an incompleted road which had slight prospect of earning much to meet its interest. The Erie, however, under Gould's leadership, during the following nine months met all these obligations and in addition entered upon a large expansion program.

Gould's first step was the sale at a loss of Erie stock and the Boston bonds just purchased from Vanderbilt and Eldridge. Gould meanwhile faced an important personal problem. He was president, not by grace of shareholders' votes, but by an extra-legal proceeding. Not until October could he be legally elected president. The campaign to insure his success was carefully prepared. Under the legal covering of a change in the by-laws, he announced on behalf of the executive committee, that the transfer books would be closed fifteen days earlier than in 1867.[^22] This action prevented a number of stockholders from casting their votes. To make the prohibition against voting by other stockholders even stronger, he secured a by-law to make it illegal to cast any votes by proxy. Although the anti-Gould stockholders had not yet awakened to the situation, Gould took no chances.

He now took a further step. Trading upon the carelessness of the stockholders, he not only prevented those stockholders from voting who were unable to attend the meeting in person, but he also proposed to vote their stock himself. A large number of shares were held by foreign stockholders, many of whom had not taken the trouble to transfer the shares to their names. When Gould, Drew and associates in March, 1868, converted the bonds into shares, they transferred the stock on the books of the company to the names of two brokers. When investors bought the stock, they did not transfer the stock to their own names. A power of attorney gave them title to the property. Gould voted all these shares in favor of his ticket.

By these devices, Gould, despite his small holdings of the company's stock, was able to control the election. To strengthen further his hold upon the company's management, his eye fell upon the Tammany politicians. The head of the Tammany ring was the notorious William Tweed, who had originally opposed Gould. Gould had previously approached Tweed to induce him to prevail upon Judge Barnard to issue an injunction, but Tweed had refused. When he was informed, however, the day following his refusal that he could make some money for himself, Tweed agreed, and thereupon asked Judge Barnard, as an act of friendship to him, to issue the desired injunction.[^23] Tweed later received, apparently without any cash consideration, a block of Erie stock.[^24] Tweed, together with Sweeny, his political ally, were elected to the Erie's board in October as part of the Gould slate.

By elevating Tweed to the Erie board, Gould also secured the support of Judge Barnard. Barnard, who had supplied injunctions at Vanderbilt's request, would now supply injunctions at Gould's request.

By these means Gould and his allies were elected to the Erie board by a substantial majority. Gould was legally elected president, and Fisk, his coarse mouthpiece, was made a member of the board. Gould also controlled the executive committee, which was the governing body between board meetings, and Gould saw to it that there were few such meetings.

In the space of one year Gould had defeated Vanderbilt, the country's leading railroad man, and Drew, the country's leading railroad speculator. He had acquired full control of the Erie, one of the major eastern trunk lines, and had revealed to Vanderbilt clearly for the first time the identity of his railroad antagonist.

Even though master of the company's destinies, Gould had not yet solved its financial problems. His first task was to raise additional funds to keep the Erie afloat, to meet its operating expenses and to pay its floating debt. In view of the company's financial condition he could find no market for its securities through established banking channels. There was, however, always a speculative market for Erie stock. There may have been no earnings but there were hopes. Though the road could not sell the stock without approval of two-thirds of the stockholders, Gould, in charge of its affairs, could continue to sell convertible bonds. The executive committee had full liberty of action, and Gould dominated the committee. On August 5, 1868, the committee authorized the president to sell $20,000,000 of convertible bonds at prices and on terms he thought best. Between October 16 and 24, after the stockholders had elected Gould to the presidency, the company issued the bonds. They were promptly converted into stock and the stock sold at about 40, its current market price. According to Gould, the bonds were sold quietly by H. N. Smith of the brokerage firm of Smith, Gould & Martin.[^25]

Even before these Erie securities were sold, and before Gould was elected president, he was already laying plans for a stock-market foray based upon another idea. He decided to exploit the strategic weakness of the national banking system. Bank reserves consisted of specie and legal tender, both of which were in short supply. The locking up of greenbacks for the purpose of reducing the supply of lendable funds for speculative purposes had been tried a number of times. Withdrawal of legal tender from circulation could be most effective in the fall months. At that time funds were normally withdrawn from New York City to the West to finance the fall movement of crops. The supply of money was thereby reduced and the price of current funds increased. Early in September, 1868, the supply of money appeared to be excessive. Any attempt to produce a financial crisis by withdrawing legal tender and thus accelerate a deflation, was likely, in the opinion of a critic just beginning its persistent quarter-of-a-century attack on Gould, to be temporary and the effect doubtful.[^26]

During these weeks Gould and his group were selling the Erie shares which the road had purchased from Vanderbilt, and in addition borrowed more shares to sell short for their own accounts. The price of Erie, despite the rise in the general market, was down substantially from early July.

The money market, as well as the stock market, puzzled informed financial observers, who believed that money would continue easy. In the first week of October, however, money rates suddenly rose to 7 per cent. Monetary analysts now first recognized the fact that securities and national bank notes were being used to borrow funds. The proceeds of loans were taken in legal tender, withdrawn from the market and locked up by the borrower. And the borrower was Gould. The collateral for the loans consisted of property owned partly by Gould and partly by the Erie.

The stock market, however, was not convinced, and for the first three weeks in October prices advanced. Erie rose, too, fluctuating between 47½ and 50; thereafter, from October 20, Erie declined persistently. Rumors spread that the Erie had resumed the issue of convertible bonds, and the stock exchange appointed a committee to investigate. This action suited Gould's purpose well. He could now excite fear and stimulate further sales of Erie. He therefore informed the committee that since the end of the Vanderbilt litigation the road had authorized the issue of $10,000,000 additional convertible bonds, $5,000,000 of which had already been converted into stock. It would furthermore require strong efforts, he said, to prevent a default on the payment of Erie's acceptances due January first.[^27] The Erie continued to drop and on October 30 the price reached 35¼. A few days later the selling spread to other securities but Erie remained steady. By the end of the month the truth was revealed. Gould and his group had withdrawn from $12,000,000 to $15,000,000 of legal tender.

The general stock market by this time was demoralized. Wheat dropped twenty-five cents a bushel, and cotton from three to four cents a pound. Government bonds declined 4 per cent in two days, and money rates soared from 7 per cent to 50 per cent, and then to 150 per cent. Gould in a few weeks had thus precipitated "the greatest difficulty which [had] presented itself in the commercial community in regulating the operation of the finances since the organization of the banking system."[^28]

In the midst of this panic selling and shortly before Erie reached its record low, Drew entered the market. As a trader in Erie stock he was now an outsider. He had had little experience with Gould and, taking his public statements at their face value, sold 70,000 shares of Erie short at prices not much higher than 40. Large blocks of English-held Erie stocks were also sold. Since it took some time to mail the stock from England, the English shareholders were technically short of the market. In accordance with the rules of the Exchange, they were required to make immediate delivery. They therefore borrowed Erie shares, the loan to be repaid when the stocks arrived. This steady selling by the general trading public, by Drew, and by English sources did not, however, depress Erie any further. Yet pessimism was widespread and money tight.

All this was classical background for the execution of a typical Gould market climax. The funereal Friday gloom was followed by a Saturday financial blessing, for on that morning Erie suddenly shot upward from 36½ to 52½. On Monday, Erie, "amid one of the wildest scenes ever witnessed on the Stock Exchange, was run up to 61 in half an hour,"[^29] wrote the chronicler of the Erie's history, and the monetary stringency suddenly eased.

Gould had closed the trap and Drew was cornered. A man of affairs, long experienced in the intricacies of trading, Drew immediately recognized his danger. Against Gould, however, he was an amateur. Drew had heavy paper losses, and again, as in the Harlem corner a few years before, he refused to abide by his contracts and threatened suit. He asked Gould and Fisk to sell him the Erie stock necessary to deliver under his short contracts. If Gould did not have the stock, Drew insisted, he (Gould) could easily manufacture a supply through the now normal method of issuing convertible bonds.[^30]

Gould did not relent and made no concessions to Drew. On the contrary, he picked up valuable information from him. Drew had been in touch with a representative of some English Erie stockholders represented in this country by August Belmont & Co—a firm which had decided to bring suit against Gould and his associates. The day before their attorneys were to appear in court, Drew met Fisk and Gould privately. Unless he was given some stock to fulfill his engagements, Drew warned them, he would go over to the opposition.

Gould now had inside information. He knew that on Monday morning, November 16, Drew and English stockholders would begin judicial proceedings. On that day the Belmont counsel appeared before Judge Sutherland and asked for an injunction to restrain the Erie directors from issuing new stock or removing the company's funds beyond the jurisdiction of the court. The judge was asked to prevent Gould from doing in November what he had so successfully done in March. The court was also asked to appoint a receiver. Both petitions were granted.

Gould, however, taking advantage of the information Drew had imparted to him the day before, had anticipated the Belmont suit. As soon as Drew left, Gould ordered an Erie ferry superintendent to appear before Gould's new ally, Judge Barnard, early Monday morning and apply for a receiver. The revelations of the applicant probably did not surprise the judge, who immediately appointed a receiver, and the receiver was none other than Gould himself. Barnard on request also enjoined the parties in the Belmont suit from proceeding under their injunction.

Gould had created a complicated situation. The Erie had two receivers and was subjected to two sets of judicial injunctions. Delay was inevitable, a condition agreeable to Gould but not to Drew. Drew wanted some stock to settle his short contracts, but Gould's strategy frustrated his hopes.

Gould's ability in handling these complicated financial-legal problems was finally beginning to be recognized. In the accounts of the Erie incidents that had appeared in legal and lay periodicals, the writers described the work of Drew and Vanderbilt but scarcely mentioned Gould.[^31] His discomfiting of Drew, however, brought him squarely to the forefront. His strategy in anticipating Belmont and Drew in the battle of judicial injunctions, in the opinion of a New York financial writer, exhibited "the presence of the master mind which [had] planned and carried out all the magnificent schemes connected with the speculation in Erie. However questionable these schemes, ... their skill and success [exhibited] Napoleonic genius on the part of him who conceived them."[^32]

Gould's strategy, however, was not yet fully unfolded. Two days after he had been appointed receiver, he appeared before Judge Barnard to relate that the Belmont counsel had raised some questions about the legality of the Erie stock issue. He wanted above all to make the stock legal, and therefore proposed that the court authorize the repurchase of this stock with company funds at prices less than par. The request was promptly granted. The judge thus authorized the use of Erie's money to repurchase stock at prices up to $100 a share, sold less than two months before at about $40 a share.

Even this was not the end. Gould moved swiftly from court to court, and soon discovered a federal judge—Blatchford—to serve as the vehicle for the issue of another extraordinary order. Upon application of a small stockholder, he appointed a receiver to administer the $8,000,000 of funds allegedly received by Erie from the sale in October of 200,000 shares of stock, and that receiver again was Gould. It is unnecessary to trace in detail the twists and turns of these judicial proceedings, as they are not relevant to the main issue. The point is that Drew did not get the Erie shares. Instead, he settled with Gould at about 57 or 58. Thereafter the price dropped to about 40 and Drew lost over $1,000,000.[^33]

It is clear that Gould had impaired the value of the Erie stock. The stockholders were worse off than they were a year before Gould's acquisition of control. More than 300,000 shares of the Erie had been issued, and, except for some minor improvements and the $5,000,000 of Boston's bonds which were soon to pass their interest, the Erie treasury had nothing to show. Gould nevertheless succeeded in making a case for himself. In December, just before he turned to a series of new adventures, he issued an optimistic statement to the company's shareholders. The Erie, he said, had done many notable things: it had built a twenty-mile extension between Buffalo and Suspension Bridge to connect with other lines, from which it would get an increased annual gross business of from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000, it had built a short line between New York and Newburgh on the Hudson, and it had made a profitable contract with the United States Express Company increasing the compensation of the Erie. The executive committee had also directed the president to sue Vanderbilt to recover the $1,000,000 commission paid him in the July settlement and to force him to buy back $5,000,000 par of Erie stock for $3,500,000. Suits had already been begun against Drew to compel him to account to the Erie for about $1,000,000 of profits made from his lake steamships.

"Whenever the facts are fully known and the public becomes aware of what is being done to make the Erie Railway the most magnificent and perfect railway line in the country and the pride of the City and State," declared Gould, "then the acts of the present managers will be appreciated."[^34] Although the facts in the statement were correct, they were nevertheless facts which were carefully selected. The average stockholder, uninformed of business and economic backgrounds, had neither the experience nor the training to discriminate between important and unimportant matters. Although the facts presented by Gould were accurate, they did not embody the truth. The few improvements to which he referred represented an insubstantial investment compared with the millions which had been raised through stock issues and largely lost almost immediately thereafter; while further funds were lost through stock speculations of Gould, Drew, Fisk, Vanderbilt, Work, Schell, and others.

There was little doubt, however, that the public statement made by Gould in December was satisfactory to many shareholders. Gould had taken over a weak property; he was introducing improvements and would soon make the property profitable. Within the next few weeks he made an equally satisfactory impression upon representatives of the public interest. A state legislative committee, appalled at the outpouring of securities by the Erie, as well as by the Vanderbilt lines, made an investigation. Gould appearing as a witness proved to be "the most intelligent and thoroughly posted witness the committee have had before them."[^35] Despite his multitude of speculations, his violations of court injunctions, his buying of judges and legislators, and his manipulation of the country's banking system, Gould was recognized as an able, well-informed, and intelligent business leader. He had severe critics but he also had loyal admirers. Still in his early thirties, he was a factor not to be ignored.
