# Chapter XIV - Gould Acquires the Western Union

To Gould's astute mind, the expansion in the railroad industry inevitably led to expansion in the telegraph industry. Under the Supreme Court ruling, a new railroad was a new telegraph customer. Gould, as the controlling factor in a railroad, could contract with Gould, the controlling factor in the new American Union, for telegraph service to compete and perhaps supplant the Western Union.

In building up the competitive position of his American Union to a point of effective striking power, Gould was challenging one of the country's largest corporate enterprises. The Western Union was a prosperous dividend payer, and in the expanding telegraph industry it had little competition. Its contracts with the railroads, long judicially regarded as exclusive, at least prior to a Supreme Court decision in 1879, had made the pathway of competitors difficult. Since its organization in 1856 it had absorbed numerous companies and now only a few outside its corporate family remained. Gould's effort to break the Western Union's grasp on the industry with his Atlantic and Pacific had failed, and the company met the same fate as all predecessors. It was bought out by the Western Union.

Aside from its excellent financial condition, its real strength lay in its railroad contracts. It was precisely this citadel of Western Union strength which Gould attacked. No sooner was he in control of a road than he challenged the Western Union contract. Vanderbilt fought back with injunctions, the same weapon that his father had wielded more than a decade before in the Erie battle. The father, however, struck on the offensive; the son, except on rare occasions, acted on the defensive.

The Western Union's financial strength, paradoxically enough, proved to be a fatal weakness in the contest with its rival. Its controlling stockholders came from eastern financial groups. Vanderbilt was looked upon as the leader of the rank and file of the conservative-minded investor-stockholders. Another large stockholder with an investor following was Edwin D. Morgan, no longer active in business and now primarily interested in preserving his income by a continued flow of dividends. Taylor of the National City Bank was another large stockholder. Western Union was thus controlled by conservative interests, cautious in their make-up and careful to maintain the company's financial position and earning power. The managers were not dynamic businessmen; they were passive investors ready to sacrifice corporate verities in return for immediate income. This defensive policy was a weakness of which Gould in 1880 and 1881 took advantage, even as Cornelius Vanderbilt had with the New York Central in 1866 and 1867.

The Western Union, sure of its monopolistic position, belittled the new American Union. Its board members did not appreciate Gould's capacity for bold action in unexpected quarters. Little fight could be expected from Vanderbilt. Other members of the board had had but slight experience with Gould, and had not yet listened to his vague and alluring promises. Vanderbilt paid scant attention to the growth of the American Union since Gould kept him busy in the railroad field. In an effort to defend himself against Gould in the railroad arena and perhaps to take the initiative, Vanderbilt ranged far and wide. Gould foiled him at almost all points.

Gould first made a number of small acquisitions. He then went after bigger game. The Baltimore & Ohio which in 1879 was operating its own telegraph system had an excellent credit standing. It was not overcapitalized. Its stock for this reason alone had a good credit standing. A record of dividend payments justified its position as a high grade investment. Garrett, president, leading stockholder and for many years its policy-maker, was a strong and independent character. He early determined to operate, so far as possible, his own telegraph, express, sleeping-car and other auxiliary services. Earlier, in the seventies, he had allied the Baltimore & Ohio's telegraph system with the Atlantic & Pacific, and when in 1877 it sold out to the Western Union, he took advantage of some "peculiar phraseology"[^1] in the agreement with the Atlantic & Pacific and prevented the transfer of its wires to the Western Union. To Gould the prospect of getting the road's telegraph business for the account of the American Union was attractive; he had little difficulty in convincing Garrett of the virtue of joining hands with that company. Playing on Garrett's prejudices, he roundly denounced the telegraph monopoly. Garrett became a member of the American Union's board, and bought stock in the company.[^2]

Garrett was again in fighting trim; he was again challenging the great monopoly. Since he did nothing by halves, his support of Gould's American Union was wholehearted. No sooner had the company received Garrett's aid than the stations of the Baltimore & Ohio, "as if by magic,"[^3] were decorated with American Union signboards. The four thousand miles of lines thus added to the American Union were a significant acquisition, constituting early in January, 1880, about one-third of the total wire mileage of the American Union system.[^4]

Despite the alliance with the Baltimore & Ohio, Gould's American Union at the turn of the year 1880 was not in a powerful position. The Western Union still maintained most of its railroad contracts and owned or controlled the telegraph wires located on the main railroad lines, thus maintaining a significant advantage over competitors. The American Union could not erect wires along main railroad lines, and its wires were "largely along the wagon-roads, or alongside and just outside the fence lines of the railroads."[^5] The American Union was knocking at the gates of the monopoly but had not yet penetrated its defenses.

Before the new year was many weeks old, however, the position of the American Union was strengthened. As a result of the merger with the Kansas Pacific in January, the enlarged Union Pacific now owned the Kansas Pacific from Kansas City to Denver, the Denver Pacific from Denver to a connection with its old Omaha line, and a number of other smaller railroad properties. The system lines also reached important local points in wide areas in which there were almost no other lines of telegraph communication. By early 1880 despite the succession of Western Union injunctions, the American Union had completed lines to both Omaha and Kansas City. Over the main line of the Union Pacific from Omaha to Ogden was a telegraph wire owned by the company and used for its own railroad purposes. Another wire originally built by the Union Pacific was leased in 1869 to the Atlantic & Pacific, the controlling interest in which was acquired by the Western Union in 1877. Still another was built and operated by the Western Union. On the Kansas & Pacific and other roads included in the new Union Pacific, the Western Union used the wires under an exclusive contract. One line of wires was set apart for use by the railroad, and the others were owned and operated by the Western Union. The American Union wires connected with all of these. Gould decided to bid for the entire telegraph business and eliminate the Western Union from the Union Pacific system.

A few weeks after the Kansas Pacific merger he outlined a policy to be executed immediately. In control of the American Union he asked the Union Pacific to accept and transmit telegraph messages on the same basis as the Western Union. Under the new Supreme Court doctrine, the Union Pacific was at liberty to accede to this request. The Western Union's exclusive contract was no longer a hindrance. If the Union Pacific accepted, it would have a contract with both the Western Union and the American Union. The Western Union probably expected Gould to go so far and no further. Gould as usual did the unexpected. He wanted more for his American Union than another contract competitive with the Western Union. For the American Union to build a parallel line along the railroad's right of way would have been expensive. Gould therefore aimed to eliminate the Western Union from its position on the Union Pacific and allied lines, and to put the American Union in its place. To do this it was necessary to invalidate existing contracts and to seize the occupied property of the enemy immediately, and not await, with all the attendant delays, the directions of the courts of the land.

Gould opened operations by engaging as counsel John F. Dillon (full name is repeated to avoid confusion with Sidney Dillon), who was then beginning a long and distinguished career in his service. With his help, Gould was able to interpret contracts in diametrically opposite ways at different times in accordance with his changing interests. He asked John F. Dillon (and his associate, Sidney Bartlett) to pass upon the legality of the 1869 lease of the Union Pacific's wires to the Atlantic & Pacific. John F. Dillon did not long delay his reply, and his opinion was, of course, favorable to Gould. Gould had first instructed the American Union at Omaha to ask the Western Union, controlling the lines west of Omaha, to handle the former's telegraph messages. The Western Union, on the conditions laid down by the American Union, had refused. John F. Dillon and Bartlett were asked whether the Union Pacific legally should not be operating its own lines. Could the Union Pacific, asked Gould, turn over by lease or otherwise, its telegraph wires to the Atlantic & Pacific? Counsel replied in the negative. The Union Pacific had issued bonds secured by a mortgage on its railroad and telegraph lines. The Union Pacific owned the telegraph, and it was therefore the duty of the Union Pacific under its charter to operate the telegraph. It could not refuse to receive and send messages for the American Union Telegraph without violating its duty.[^6] This legal interpretation was subsequently approved by a federal judge.

A year later Gould wanted help of the same counsel. By that time he had succeeded in making a new contract between the Union Pacific and the Western Union. He now controlled the Western Union, and the Union Pacific was no longer operating its own telegraph line just as it operated no line a year before. What was illegal for the Union Pacific in February, 1880, became legal one year later. Counsel had overlooked in 1880 a section of the Act giving the Western Union certain rights, but in 1881, with the aid of Gould, counsel discovered this section of the Act. This gave the Western Union new rights, and enabled Gould to conclude his ardently desired contract with the Union Pacific.

Gould in February, 1880, was not as yet solicitous about the rights and privileges of the Western Union. He was, however, deeply concerned with the privileges and profits of the American Union. Fortified with the opinions of John F. Dillon and Bartlett, and operating through the Union Pacific, he prepared his campaign. Secretly, he installed new transmitting batteries at the eastern termini of the Union Pacific at Kansas City and Denver. Suddenly, in late February, he cut the Western Union lines away from its main batteries at these points, and connected the secretly constructed batteries with the Union Pacific wires.[^7] The seizure was carried out without interruption from the Western Union. "Last night," wired an officer of the American Union on the twenty-seventh of February, "I took possession of all lines on the Union Pacific." It was a short, prosaic and ordinary business message; but it ended the first round in another corporate battle, with Gould on the aggressive.

The struggle, recognized almost immediately as one "of large proportions,"[^8] was transferred to the courts. The Western Union was deprived of connections to the Pacific coast, and from the mountain sections it could reach the East only over the telegraph wires of the Atchison. The federal judge, to whom the Western Union appealed for an injunction to restrain the moves of Gould's corporate satellites, agreed with the views of John F. Dillon and Bartlett that the contract by which the Union Pacific had leased its wires to the Atlantic & Pacific was illegal; he did not agree with the moves of Gould in transforming these views into action. The Atlantic & Pacific and therefore the Western Union, insisted the judge, had acquired some property rights. The company was entitled to "due process"; and the court ordered the Atlantic & Pacific to repossess its property. Also, said the court, the Western Union had an interest in its own line on the Union Pacific which the court was determined to protect, and accordingly ordered the restoration of that line. The arbitrary seizure of the telegraph wires by Gould was "not calculated," said the court, "to create the most favorable impression on a court of equity. ..."[^9]

It was probable that Gould entertained no serious desire to create a favorable impression upon the court of equity. To him the court battle was only incidental, since victory was to be won not in the courts of law, but on the Stock Exchange. Gould was interested neither in buying nor in winning a lawsuit. His ambition, dating back to 1874, was to acquire control of the profitable telegraph business, a purpose which could be consummated only by seizure of control of the Western Union. Court battles were of importance to him only in so far as they enabled him to achieve this major purpose. If he could litigate the Western Union stockholders into uncertainty by keeping the case in court, his objective would be realized. It was not until early fall that the court handed down a final decision to the effect that although the Kansas Pacific had the exclusive use of one wire it could not interfere with the Western Union in the use of the other two. The Western Union was happy; the decision, it proclaimed, was "a substantial victory for the Western Union and [left] them in uninterrupted possession of their lines on the railroad named."[^10]

Although competition between the two telegraph companies meanwhile increased, there was no serious rate war. The Western Union followed its historic policy of reducing rates as technological improvements and enlarged sales reduced costs. These rate reductions[^11] were no more substantial than those which had occurred from time to time over the preceding ten-year period. A genuine rate war did not develop. Gould's Atlantic & Pacific Telegraph experience had taught him a lesson. Losses of the Atlantic & Pacific had been heavy, and equally heavy losses might make it impossible for him to continue active competition with the well-established Western Union. The Western Union, even at the height of the American Union's power in the summer of 1880, had many offices at non-competing points. Gould appreciated that a war which would bear heavily upon the earnings of the American Union would bear lightly, in view of the heavy volume of non-competitive business, on the Western Union. The American Union, therefore, did not repeat the experiment of a war of rates.[^12] Even though no such wars occurred, the effect on Western Union earnings was substantial. Meanwhile the loss of its monopolistic position on the Gould railroads was becoming serious. The Western Union knew that it was in for a fight.

Gould had succeeded in impairing the trade position of the Western Union as no competitor had ever done before. As Gould kept adding to his railroad empire in 1880, the Western Union's monopolistic position, achieved by virtue of its railroad contracts, was steadily weakened.

The relationship of these railroad acquisitions to the future earnings of the Western Union was well recognized. Many of its stockholders therefore sold part of their holdings and retained smaller portions which they believed they could hold during a period of depressed earnings. In dealing with the threat of the American Union, the Western Union board was divided. It was a fatal division especially in the presence of such a watchful, ingenious, and informed antagonist as Gould. Instead of uniting against the common enemy, the board fought amongst themselves. A faction led by its president, Norvin Green, was all for fight. He was in favor of stripping down, of reducing expenses, of throwing off the luxurious fat, and of engaging in a knock-down-and-drag-out fight with Gould's American Union.[^13] For such a battle the American Union had many advantages, but the Western Union had many more. In addition to the thousands of non-competitive points, it could offer the best services between the large industrial and commercial cities. It had few fixed charges, and could therefore pass dividends and use its resources to wage the battle of competition. Another group, led by Vanderbilt, was in favor of conciliation. There was an army of approximately 2,200 shareholders who, as usual, were interested only in immediate results. They were investors who had bought their stock for income. They wanted dividends, not rate wars. Like the democracies of recent years, they wanted peace.

It was a distressing situation and the alternative was not clear. Before the Western Union could chart a policy, Gould was already executing one in the stock market. In conjunction with a number of other traders, including Keene who had made a number of successful trades, Gould formed a stock pool in order to depress the price of Western Union. He convinced his associates that with the American Union becoming ever more aggressive, the Western Union earnings were bound to decline. This was not yet clearly recognized by the average investor and trader, who respond only to facts and tendencies which are visible clearly to all who read and run. The Western Union early in 1880 was selling at a high price. The general market was strong; in such a market it was easy for Gould and his group to build up a large short interest. Late in April of 1880 the price of Western Union's stock declined sharply. The decline was a "puzzle" to the financial district. The report was current that Gould had bought 100,000 shares from Vanderbilt, but this Vanderbilt denied.[^14] In the following months the decline continued, and stories of dissension among board members became a matter of public notice.[^15] The annual election was approaching and a contest over corporate policy impended. Gould, watching the progress of this contest, discovered that several members of the board had sold large blocks of stock. Some of the sellers believed that after the price dropped they could buy the stock back and then vote it at the election. They were thus unconsciously allying themselves with Gould who, in order to strengthen his hand, entered the proxy market. That market was distinct from the market for the stock. When the speculators returned to the market to rebuy the Western Union they had sold, in order thereby to vote the stock at the election, they discovered that the proxies had been bought by Gould. Buying by short sellers also occurred about this time. Meanwhile the price rose to about 105.

Despite the rise, the bear pool remained intact. In the rising market, prices of good stocks advanced, while the price of Western Union suddenly dropped. In the first week of December it fell below 90. Then came the real news: the Western Union published its earnings and revealed the almost complete disappearance of the previous year's surplus of $1,600,000. This was followed by a dividend reduction. Little wonder, to use the language of Vanderbilt, that the stockholders "were getting very uneasy."[^16] Reports and rumors spread thick and fast. "A thousand rumors of the disastrous condition of the company, of the impossibility of its standing against the rivalry of the American Union, and of the implacable hostility of the latter, were skillfully circulated; and the two companies, Mr. Vanderbilt controlling the one and Mr. Gould the other, entered on a war of rates, which it was declared was to be fought to the end."[^17]

The price of the stock dropped further and in a few days it sold at 82½. There, for three or four days it seemed to be stabilized, but on December 17, 1880, in the midst of a buoyant market and in heavy trading, Western Union fell to 78. The bear traders, now set for the kill, stood ready to purchase the stock at the depressed prices and to take their profit. The price, however, did not budge. At the turn of the year it suddenly jumped from less than 81 to almost 87. "As an exhibition of superb manipulation," remarked one financial analyst, "this price movement has never been surpassed."[^18] Who was doing the manipulating, nobody knew—at least nobody who was willing to inform the outside public. The same writer who observed the manipulation reported that the "average operator" was convinced that the rise was due to the purchases of Vanderbilt.[^19] The traders themselves who were (outside of the negotiating parties) the closest observers of market happenings knew as little as anybody else. They were described as being "very bitter."[^20] They had been told, so they complained, to buy when prices were high, and were told later to sell when prices were low.

Even the members of the bear pool, those who organized for the sole purpose of making a profit out of the movements in Western Union stock, were discomfited. When they tried to rebuy stock at the low prices of mid-December, they discovered little stock offered for sale. The market shot up rapidly as soon as they entered substantial buying orders. Gould alone benefited from this remarkable operation. When his associates in the bear pool were selling, or at best, when they were not buying for the purpose of completing their short selling contracts, Gould was buying. In all he bought more than 90,000 shares, and he was therefore, late in December, 1880, the largest single shareholder. In the strong investment market he sold his Union Pacific stock at high prices and invested part of the proceeds in Western Union.

The Western Union board in late December, though not aware of this development, was acutely aware of two others. The first was the status of the Pennsylvania Railroad contract. The road had never signed an exclusive agreement with the Western Union and felt at liberty to offer a competitive contract for the use of its right of way on its lines east of Pittsburgh to both of the leading telegraph companies. Gould on behalf of the American Union accepted a contract[^21] on the basis of a price so high, according to an official of the Baltimore & Ohio, that for the mere right to locate its poles and wires on the road, the company agreed to pay the Pennsylvania an annual sum which if capitalized would have equaled the entire cost of its own line on that road.[^22] Having given the American Union a new contract, the Pennsylvania in September, 1880, notified the Western Union that existing arrangements would end on the first of January, and began negotiations for the erection of a line of its own telegraph poles on the northern side of the right of way. Finally, on the sixth of January, with the Western Union defending its exclusive contract, which it insisted could not be canceled at the pleasure of the railway company, the Pennsylvania gave notification that existing arrangements would end forthwith.[^23] The Western Union took the case to court asking that the Pennsylvania be compelled to uphold existing contracts.

In December, while the Pennsylvania problem was approaching a climax, Gould struck another blow. Neither of the rival telegraph companies controlled the cable business, although each had established a working arrangement with an independently owned cable company. After a number of rate wars amongst themselves, the cable companies on September 24, 1880, entered into an agreement for the pooling of receipts and the fixing of minimum rates.[^24] Of these companies the Anglo-American Cable, with four cables and a capitalization of $35,000,000, worked with the Western Union; the Direct Cable, with one cable and a capitalization of $6,500,000, worked with the Atlantic & Pacific; and a French cable company, with one cable and a capitalization of $10,000,000, worked with the American Union. All these concerns were controlled by foreign capital. To the ordinary mind this fact might seem unimportant. To Gould, however, it fitted well with a far-reaching plan of international significance. In the Erie regime of the late sixties and early seventies he never overlooked an opportunity to champion the Erie as the savior of railroad competition in New York City. Only the Erie, he said, stood in the breach and saved the city from the grasping Vanderbilt monopoly. Now, in 1880, Gould thundered against the foreign cable monopoly. He would promote a national independent cable enterprise; he would break the monopoly; he would reduce the artificially maintained rates. The average capitalization per cable of the existing companies exceeded $8,000,000, he said, and he would build a cable for $3,000,000.

In late December he was ready for action. He organized a construction company with a capitalization of $10,000,000 to build a new trans-Atlantic cable, and called immediately for 70 percent of the subscription. His success was astonishing, and in forty hours the money was raised.[^25] The Gould cable company—the American Telegraph & Cable—was a new threat to the Western Union, since it would be able to break up the existing rate structure and thereby reduce Western Union revenues.

Although by the end of 1880 the Gould telegraph combination had potentialities of becoming a powerful enterprise, it was not as yet a profitable one. Indeed the American Union's receipts had never equaled its expenses, although at the time of the consolidation with the Western Union it was just about paying its way.[^26] The future of the American Union, however, in the opinion of its owners and managers was bright. The president thought that it could earn 20 percent on its investment. Gould was more conservative; he believed that it would earn about 6 percent. The company's connections with his railroads, Gould was convinced, would make the American Union highly profitable. "My own ownership in great roads," he declared, "my directorship and control in others, enabled the American Union to make contracts of incalculable value."[^27]

Despite the dangerous growth of this competitor, the Western Union board was still in the throes of internal conflict. It had not as yet been able to lay down any general policies. While the board was wrestling with its problems, a ray of sunshine suddenly appeared. This turned out to be Gould himself. Through Dillon, president of the Union Pacific, the information was relayed to Vanderbilt that Gould was ready to talk terms. Negotiations opened with Gould's usual deftness. He was the largest Western Union stockholder. Though he appreciated that the Western Union might decide to fight, he knew that an important group wanted peace. Through Dillon he informed Vanderbilt that he would not oppose an "amicable settlement." Gould thus succeeded, as he had a little more than a year before in the Union Pacific merger, in placing the other party on the defensive. Holding the whip hand in the negotiations, he was ready to see Vanderbilt if Vanderbilt was agreeable, and Vanderbilt was agreeable. To use his own language, Vanderbilt on Sunday night, January 9, at his home, agreed to talk terms to "the great Mogul."[^28]

The negotiations were conducted with the same skill and rapidity that had characterized his negotiations in the Union Pacific merger. The troubles of the Western Union, Gould demonstrated, could easily be solved. He was all sweetness and amity. He, the chief enemy of the Western Union only a few days before, was now its chief proprietor. He was willing to adjust, arrange, compromise. "We were taken by surprise," said Green, the leader of the fighting party,[^29] and, continued Green, though the board could have said it was not ready for agreement, it still had 2,000 shareholders to consider. "We could not afford to forego an opportunity so unexpectedly offered, and we accepted the negotiation."[^30] The Western Union board in 1881, like Joseph Stalin in August, 1939, was presented with a gift of peace. All of the acute problems, all the frightful ills which might arise from an impending war, now disappeared.

Negotiations proceeded swiftly. Gould as master of the situation aimed to please everybody. He was anxious to please the stockholders of the American Union. He had only a fair amount of its stock and bonds. A good price for American Union would indeed enhance his own holdings; but even more important, would assure the loyal following of his associates. He also aimed to please the minority stockholders of the Atlantic & Pacific. Should they profit they would attribute their success to Gould. Finally, he aimed to please both himself and the 2,000 stockholders in the Western Union.

In the transaction that was finally made, the "actual value" of the American Union entered but slightly into the calculation of the Western Union board, anxious as it was to rid itself of a competitor and to enter upon a corporate career of harmony and dividend payments. Gould in satisfying the board arranged also for the satisfaction of all corporate interests. The Western Union issued $15,000,000 of stock to pay for the securities of the American Union, a price equivalent to about twice its original cost.[^31] Another $8,400,000 in stock was paid for the Atlantic & Pacific stock, giving the latter a price of 60, in contrast to the price of 25 paid in the agreement of 1877. Finally, to make everybody happy, the Western Union declared a stock dividend of $15,500,000. This was surely a piece of curious historical irony. The stock dividend represented earnings invested in the property and never capitalized, of approximately $17,000,000. Although the Western Union's practice of reinvesting earnings was begun on a small scale in 1866, it did not reach substantial proportions until the advent of Cornelius Vanderbilt in 1869. It was the soundness of his financial policies which made the Western Union stock dividend possible, and it was Vanderbilt's son, William H., who handed over a large part of the value which his father had created, to his father's arch-foe—Gould.

Before the end of the month the transaction was completed. On February 5, 1881, Gould and his ally, Sage, were elected to the board of the Western Union. Thomas T. Eckert, president of the American Union, was also elected a director, and appointed vice president and general manager of the property. Green, who had been prepared to fight Gould and his American Union, was too able an executive to be dismissed. Gould retained his services, and he continued as president of the enlarged property.

Gould was now the largest stockholder and the policy-maker of one of the most influential and profitable companies in the country. As a gatherer of news, through its contracts with the Associated Press, the company had no rival. It also did a large part of the railroad-telegraph business of the country.

The American Union-Western Union consolidation produced a storm of protest. From journals of financial opinion came strong condemnations of the financial phases. One described the combination categorically as "another immense stock-watering upon which the people must pay dividends," and estimated the capital actually invested in the system at about $25,000,000 as compared with $80,000,000 in outstanding securities.[^32] The business and commercial public also were up in arms. The Cotton Exchange of New York, for example, talked of organizing an independent company. Committees from the Cotton and Produce Exchanges of New York met with committees from the Chicago exchanges. They spoke hopefully of organizing an independent company, and followed with the announcement of the organization of the Merchants' Telegraph Company which in Chicago alone raised $500,000 in stock subscriptions.[^33] In the halls of Congress there were voices loud in protest. Aside from local reactions, they took the shape of a bill to aid a company to build lines and to authorize the government to permit it to use public and private lands, post roads and bridges.[^34]

Although the government accomplished nothing, private enterprise was active and new competition was not long in coming. Within less than six months after the merger, the Postal Telegraph, destined to remain as the only surviving competitor of the Western Union, was organized with Keene as president. Keene was Gould's most prominent associate in the Western Union's bear pool of the preceding year.

If the public and Gould's enemies were dissatisfied with Gould's work, the telegraph stockholders were well pleased. From the shareholders of the American Union and the Atlantic & Pacific came no bleat. They had received handsome treatment indeed and were content. To them Gould was a hero; they could thank him for spectacular profits on their stockholdings in the short period of less than a year. From the stockholding group of the Western Union, two legal efforts to test the validity of the merger evolved. One was brought by Rufus Hatch, a speculator who had frequently tilted with Gould and usually came out second. The day before the agreement of consolidation he bought 100 shares of Western Union, and four days later he bought 400 more. The judge before whom the suit was brought had little difficulty in throwing out the case. Hatch, he said, came into the court with "unclean hands" and therefore had no standing.

The other suit was brought by William S. Williams, a small stockholder of the Western Union. Williams insisted that the stock dividend was illegal; that the Western Union had overvalued both the American Union and the Atlantic & Pacific. In the long judicial contest, Williams won in the lower court but was overruled in the higher court. There remained no doubt of the legality of the Western Union stock dividend.

Long before its legality was affirmed, Gould, through the Union Pacific, signed a contract demonstrating the potentialities of the new corporate telegraph union. The Supreme Court had declared that a railroad, despite an exclusive contract, could make a contract with another telegraph company. To Gould this was not satisfactory. By the summer of 1881 he had sold his Union Pacific stock, but not his Western Union. The Union Pacific contract was valuable to the Western Union and he did not propose to lose it. With the help of counsel, he discovered a legal foundation for the doctrine that the Union Pacific did not violate the law by leasing its wires to the Atlantic & Pacific; that in fact it could make any contract, as binding as necessary, with its successor, the Western Union. In the new contract, the Union Pacific turned over its wires to the Western Union and agreed to do business with no other telegraph company. To make the provision doubly sure, the Union Pacific agreed that if any question of interpretation arose the Western Union could prosecute the case in the name of the Union Pacific.[^35]

By the end of 1881 it was clear that despite all protests, public and private, from commercial and business organizations, and from the general press, the consolidation was permanent. Gould lost no time in perfecting his grasp on the cable business. No sooner was the Western Union agreement consummated than he canceled the American Union-French company and the Atlantic and Pacific-Direct Cable contracts. Both cable companies were astounded, and promptly entered suit. Gould's legal victory was clear-cut and decisive. On technical grounds a contract which appeared to be a contract became only a legally voidable arrangement. Gould's skill in nullifying written and binding agreements was again demonstrated.

Gould meanwhile went ahead with his plan for laying new cables. The recently incorporated American Telegraph & Cable signed up with the Western Union. As soon as the cables were completed the latter would get the business; how much, the public did not know. A mysterious contract was arranged, part of the consideration being a Western Union guarantee of the cable company's bonds and 5 percent on the stock. When the construction company was organized it was proposed that the new cable company issue $10,000,000 of stock. Although that public announcement was never changed, the subscribers, when asked to exchange their certificates for new stock, discovered that the stock had been increased to $14,000,000. This was welcome news and no stockholder could object. When finally they received their certificates, they got another surprise; they were asked to sign a paper stating that they had read the contract between the Western Union and the American Telegraph & Cable, and that they had approved of the contract. This was a move by Gould to reveal in his quiet way his growing power over the world's cable business. One innocent shareholder, not appreciating the nicety of the arrangement, asked for the privilege of reading the new contract. The contract, he was informed, was not shown to anybody; but " 'it was all right,' " he was told, and of course he signed.[^36]

The Western Union had thus increased its fixed charges by $700,000. What did it get in return? In 1881 it received nothing. By the summer of 1882 the cable company at a cost of $6,000,000 finally put two cables to work.[^37] Gould's opinion of the probable cable costs were amply justified. The Western Union, however, paid a return of 5 percent, not on the $6,000,000 cost of the cables but on the cable company's stock of $14,000,000. Whether Gould personally benefited is not so clear. Gould was a heavy stockholder in Western Union, and it is conceivable that he may have lost as much from the reduced earnings on Western Union as he may have gained from the guaranteed return on his cable securities.

By late summer of 1881 the American Telegraph & Cable completed its cable, and a rate war broke out immediately. Furthermore, the new cables soon broke down and were lost. Gould competition was thus temporarily removed but the established cable companies had received a shock. They knew by the short experience what was in store for them. Gould dominated the land wires, and in the course of the next few months made it clear that he would not hesitate "to work serious injury to the old cable company by subjecting them to great embarrassment."[^38] The Gould pressure was again successful, and in March of 1882 a pooling and rate-fixing agreement among the cable companies was reached. All companies pooled their business; rates were doubled; and everybody was again happy. The Western Union, however, obtained a cut on messages from all the cable companies.[^39]

In all these complicated telegraph and cable negotiations, in the courts and in business circles, Gould showed excellent judgment. By patience, by a knowledge of the weakness of the opposition, by taking full advantage of all the openings offered by the law in the technical interpretations of business contracts, he overcame almost all opposition. In the face of storms of public protest, despite suits in the courts, despite competition from new telegraph companies, he succeeded. The path was long and rocky, and was strewn with many a serious obstacle. The cost for a time seemed heavy. Rates were reduced, losses in earnings were substantial, and dividends were cut, but in the end Gould beat down almost everybody, including the United States Government. And from a host of competitors, only the Postal Telegraph and its allied Commercial Cable survived.
