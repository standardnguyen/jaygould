# Chapter XXVII - Gould Contracts and Expands in the Southwest

In the middle eighties the Missouri Pacific system connecting St. Louis and Kansas City with Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Texas was the major system in the Southwest. Two north-and-south non-Gould lines operating between north Texas and the Gulf Coast had been unable to extend their lines further north, thus to make connections with the middle-western lines. One of these, the Houston, was in the hands of Huntington, who through a personal holding company, the Southern Development Company, held a majority interest in its stock. It was not clear what Huntington had in mind in acquiring control. Whatever may have been his objectives, they were frustrated by a serious personal financial reverse in the summer of 1884. Instead of expanding he was forced to contract. On the far western end he had to sell a part of his lines in California to another railroad, thereby permitting that road to compete more effectually for California business. His associates refused to extend their financial support, thus compelling him to relinquish those extensive plans which he had matured for the building of an all-rail transcontinental artery.

The other non-Gould north-south Texas line was the Gulf. The road's sturdy management refused to deal with Gould or any of his properties. The other major competitor of the Gould southwestern lines was the Frisco. Since 1881 the road singly and in conjunction with others had planned the construction of a connection with either one or the other of the non-Gould lines in northern Texas.[^1] Gould defeated these plans and, in conjunction with Huntington, succeeded early in 1882 in securing an interest in its stock and representation on its board.

In 1885, therefore, the railroad business in Texas with the exception of the Gulf and a number of smaller roads was controlled by Gould and Huntington. Although they had occasionally co-operated, their interests repeatedly clashed. Early in 1885, for example, a rate war broke out, but by July the contestants came together and organized a pool covering the Texas traffic.[^2] The pool soon broke down. Gould and Huntington, however, negotiated a compromise arrangement providing for a new five-year pool, subject to withdrawal upon sixty days' notice.

It looked as though peace was now to prevail in the Texas railroad industry. While Gould was preparing for peace in Texas, however, he was making ready for war in Kansas. In defying the Atchison in that area, Gould precipitated a struggle, the limits of which he probably did not appreciate. The Atchison offensive of 1886 and 1887 struck at the vitals of the Gould system, not only in Kansas and eastern Colorado but also in the Southwest. For more than two years the road had been negotiating with the Gulf to build an extension from northern Texas. Before the end of 1885 the construction was under way, and in the spring of 1886 the Atchison acquired the Gulf by an exchange of stock. Acting defensively to check Gould the Atchison may have paid a high price. Perkins of the Burlington expressed the opinion that though he had no detailed knowledge, the Atchison in acquiring this road had taken on "a pretty long line of railroad at a pretty high price."[^3] The price was high and the blow struck by the Atchison was quick and sharp. The Atchison now had a through route to the Gulf Coast. For the first time Gould was faced with a competitor that controlled a line from traffic-producing regions in Texas to Kansas City. Within the next two years, with the completion of the Atchison extension to Chicago, Gould was confronted by a competitor with a through line of its own from the Gulf Coast to Chicago.

The Atchison, furthermore, challenged for the first time the monopoly position of the Kansas & Texas in the Indian Territory. If the Atchison maintained rates and shared the existing business with the Kansas & Texas, earnings of the latter might indeed be reduced, although not sufficiently to impair the margin of safety for interest. If as a measure of retaliation for Gould's aggression in Kansas and Colorado it reduced rates, the effect on the Kansas & Texas might be disastrous. Its financial structure was weak and its physical condition poor.

The invasion of Oklahoma and Texas by the Atchison paved the way for another damaging blow to the Gould system. The Atchison had no outlet of its own to St. Louis. The Frisco, however, with which the Atchison for a number of years had worked closely, did have such an outlet. An extension of the Frisco south to north Texas would connect the road with the northern terminus of the Gulf. Such a line which had been "long contemplated and earnestly desired"[^4] would give the enlarged Atchison system an outlet to St. Louis. The Kansas & Texas would be flanked on both sides: on the west by the Atchison and on the east by the Frisco. The Texas rate stabilization which had been established in the fall of 1885 could no longer be retained. As a new line the Atchison decided to do what almost every other new road had done; the Lackawanna in 1883, the Wabash in 1880 and 1881, and the Baltimore & Ohio after completion of the Chicago extension in 1874. It cut rates and after a period of some months the road would secure enough traffic to give it a good bargaining position in a pool. Shortly after the Atchison and its allied Frisco completed their extensions to north Texas, the rate war began. It was inaugurated by Huntington's Houston which, anticipating a rate cut by the Atchison, took the initiative and opened "an animated war of freight rates."[^5] The war was short and sharp, and in two weeks an understanding was reached and rates were restored.

Gould must have realized that this settlement was only a truce and that in a short time additional wars would break out. In preparing countermoves to meet these attacks, Gould again thought in terms of establishing new through routes. His mind turned to grand competitive schemes, ignoring again, as he had so many times before, the cost elements and the relative importance of through traffic vs. local. His new lines in southern Kansas served rich grain and hog-packing districts. Growing markets for these products existed in the Southeast—in the territory beyond Memphis east of the Mississippi River. He could reach these areas over his existing system lines only by a circuitous route, east to St. Louis and south to Memphis where connection was made with southeastern roads.

He therefore conceived the idea of building a direct connection between the Kansas & Texas and the Iron Mountain at a point many miles below the Kansas City-St. Louis line of the Missouri Pacific. As if to carry out the very purpose he had in mind, local Arkansas promoters had already constructed a number of small roads paralleling the Arkansas River from the western part of that state to the southeastern section. Three separate local companies with a complementary traffic relationship were involved. Together these roads formed the Arkansas Valley route; they were nevertheless separately owned and operated. One of them with a large debt was in receivership, and Gould with his usual trading ability recognized its strategic value. He therefore purchased a majority of the outstanding bonds of the property, and with these bonds at the foreclosure sale secured full control. He could now make terms with the other two roads which could not exist except by the use of the road he just bought. Within a few months he had carried out his purpose. The other two roads sold out and by the spring of 1887 Gould and his group were elected to the boards of the three companies. Shortly thereafter the companies were merged with and formally taken over by the Missouri Pacific.

This Arkansas Valley route terminated at Fort Smith, Arkansas, on the west. Gould made arrangements for construction of an extension to connect Fort Smith with the north-and-south line of the Kansas & Texas in the Indian Territory. Upon the completion of this extension Gould would control a new short line from Kansas and eastern Colorado to tidewater. The new route would give Kansas City an outlet to tidewater by a route of 900 miles via Memphis and down the Mississippi River open all the year, against a route of 1,400 miles via St. Louis and Chicago. Nothing could overcome the advantages of this short route, asserted the operating manager of the Missouri Pacific; and Gould himself declared that he expected to take business to tidewater over this route from points as far north as Omaha.[^6]

To facilitate the movement of this traffic, Gould rushed through the extension of the Iron Mountain to Memphis, thereby making the system independent of the Memphis & Little Rock which had given him so much trouble in his efforts to acquire control at what he considered to be a reasonable price.[^7]

Thus Gould again succeeded in attracting wide publicity for a new competitive route with great possibilities. The enlarged Gould system in Kansas and Colorado, it was widely asserted, would as surely succeed in diverting traffic over the new Arkansas route to tidewater as the Union Pacific only five or six years earlier had promised to divert traffic over the enlarged Wabash.

Despite its valuable strategic position, Gould had meanwhile permitted the physical condition of the Kansas & Texas to deteriorate. "With inconsiderable exception," declared the 1892 annual report of the reorganized road, "it may be stated that no part of the line was ballasted or fenced; a large portion of the permanent way was laid with iron rails; most of the bridges were of the old pattern, wooden structures inadequate for sustaining heavy trains and exposed to constant danger from fire. The southern terminus of the main line was at a water-tank in the bush eighty miles from tide-water; an interval of sixty-seven miles interrupted the continuity of the main line in its most important part, and three small pieces of track were built with the company's funds as feeders for a rival line whilst entirely separated from contact with its own."[^8] The road was an essential part of the system through route between Kansas City and the Southwest, and between southern Kansas and the Southeast, and was also a link connecting the Texas & Pacific's transcontinental line with southern Kansas and western Missouri. Gould was therefore anxious to maintain control. The price of retention seemed, however, to be excessive. Its fixed charges were out of line with comparable properties, and existing earnings were threatened by new competition. It was probably late in 1887 that Gould made up his mind that the Kansas & Texas was too burdensome for the Missouri Pacific. By that time he had sold out most of his stocks and bonds in the road.[^9] Late in 1887, furthermore, the price of its securities began to drop. There were of course others besides Gould who understood the reasons which contributed to their price decline, although, as usual, people in the financial district, who are presumed to know most about these matters, knew in fact comparatively little. William Dowd, president of the Bank of North America, and a member of the Kansas & Texas board of directors, stated blandly that he had examined the company's books "quite thoroughly," and discovered that the company "had laid down a large amount of steel rails, so that it [was] now in first class condition."[^10] Neither was the stock exchange of any help to the innocent investor. A large part of the company's stocks and bonds were held in Holland, and its securities were therefore listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. When prices dropped, this Exchange could discover no better remedy than the appointment of an investigating committee, thereby to defend the "holders of securities against the alleged machinations of bear traders...."[^11]

The price decline led to the usual rumors. One was that the company would default in the payment of its December coupon; a story that was promptly denied. Sage pronounced it as ridiculous; the coupon and the next semi-annual coupon as well, he said, would be paid.[^12] Gould declared that the company had no floating debt, and a receiver, he insisted, had "never been dreamed of except on the street...."[^13]

The denials were similar to those which were made in May, 1884, prior to the appointment of the Wabash receiver. In this case, as with the Wabash, Gould had made up his mind to act, although he was not yet ready to show his hand. To enable him to retain control in the face of an impending receivership, he needed time to place himself in a strong strategic position. In view of the company's heavy fixed charges, possession of a large block of stock would be of little help. He could, it is true, buy some of the junior mortgage bonds. These, however, were outstanding in amounts far too large even at prevailing prices to enable him to secure a controlling interest, at bargain prices. Accordingly he resorted to the device of the floating debt—that curious instrument which had done such good service in the receivership and reorganization of the Wabash and of the Texas & Pacific. Toward the end of the year 1887, the security holders were assured, on what appeared to be the best of authority, that the company had no floating debt.[^14] Gould found little difficulty, nevertheless, in creating one, and by early April only a few weeks after the public had been assured that the company had none, it turned up with an $800,000 item borrowed from the Missouri Pacific. Gould asserted further that "additional large advances" would have to be made until the earnings improved.[^15]

Even before the formal announcement of the new debt to the Missouri Pacific, the company's bondholders and stockholders began to discover the truth. They discounted at their proper value the assurances of Gould and of corporate officers that nothing was fundamentally wrong. They appreciated at face value the superficial judgments of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange authorities, and they determined to find out the truth for themselves. Late in March they organized a committee headed as usual by a banker. The committee was authorized to secure proxies in order to elect a new board and thus get control of the new company.[^16] The committee, after unsuccessfully trying to secure information from the company, communicated with Gould. Gould, as bland and assured as always, was willing to be generous. If the committee, after acquiring control of the road on behalf of the stockholders desired to operate independently, the Missouri Pacific would give it fair treatment; and that was an important factor in its success, asserted Gould.[^17] The harmony between Gould and the committee led to a vigorous upward movement in the prices of the road's securities. "No other securities," referring to the non-Gould securities, commented a friendly Philadelphia newspaper, "have shown any such buoyancy."[^18]

If the work of the committee in securing information from Gould, despite the latter's professed spirit of co-operation, was unsuccessful, its efforts in securing proxies, on the contrary, was highly successful. The annual election was close at hand and it was clear to Gould that he would be forced to relinquish control. He accordingly called a meeting of the old board of directors and revealed the purpose of the newly created debt. The Kansas & Texas owned all the stock of the International. These securities and others held in the company's treasury had a value of about $3,000,000.[^19] At the board meeting resolutions were passed transferring these securities to the holder of the $800,000 floating debt.

Shortly thereafter the annual meeting of the Kansas & Texas was held. The Gould interest was not even represented and the new management assumed control. Resolutions were passed denouncing the actions of the Gould board, and appointing an investigating committee. The committee made an elaborate investigation and discussed numerous facts, many of which had already been known. The disclosure could not, however, save the Kansas & Texas. Receivership was essential to give the management the necessary time and capital to rehabilitate the road both physically and financially.

Receivership of the Kansas & Texas made it more than ever necessary for Gould to retain control of the International. Since the stock of that road belonged to the Kansas & Texas, it was inevitable that despite anything he could do, the Kansas & Texas could by paying the small floating debt take over the stock. With the International lost to the Gould system, traffic would go north over the lines of the Kansas & Texas to Hannibal and beyond over the Burlington. The International's rolling stock was badly run down and the company did not have enough cars to carry the available traffic. Of the locomotives still available, a number of the engines were literally worn out.[^20] The company was also in exceptionally poor financial condition, and for a number of years had operated at substantial deficits. In the fall of 1888 the company upon one occasion had only $23,000 in its treasury to meet supply vouchers, including pay rolls, of between $150,000 to $200,000.[^21]

In the summer of 1888, some months after the Kansas & Texas had been taken over by its shareholders and the lease to the Missouri Pacific canceled, it seemed inevitable that the Kansas & Texas would acquire control of the International. Although its stock was held by the Kansas & Texas, Gould's appointees remained in control. In order to give him an interest in subsequent legal proceedings, Gould advanced funds to the road to enable it to pay its bond coupons which otherwise would have defaulted. Gould kept the coupons alive and received notes from the company evidencing his advances. By November 1 he had thus accumulated a claim against the company of about $500,000. This claim, together with the unpaid coupons which he held as a lien against the road, was sufficient to give him a standing in the courts as a security holder. He then permitted the International to default.

Gould was now a floating debt creditor. What he could not do as a first mortgage bondholder he could well do as the holder of unsecured promissory notes. To exploit the notes to the maximum degree, it was essential that Gould secure a judgment in a state court in Texas, and then use this judgment as a means of securing a federal receivership.[^22] The execution of this plan precipitated a spectacular corporate and political battle which resulted in an elaborate legislative investigation of Gould's transactions and led to a series of clashes with the Kansas & Texas and its leading stockholders and bankers.

In order to obtain the desired judgment, Gould carefully prepared the way by securing local counsel who "knew" the judge. The petition to the Texas court was drafted by J. F. Dillon, and forwarded to the solicitors of the International. Gould had the International call a meeting of the directors and at that meeting a resolution was adopted authorizing one of its solicitors to confess judgment on behalf of the International. Two days later, February 11, 1889, the climax of a long-prepared campaign by Gould to precipitate the International into a federal receivership took place in a Texas court. Toward the end of the day after everybody apparently had left, Gould's solicitor, acting in behalf of the International, quietly asked the court for a judgment. Unfortunately, however, somebody had talked. Local officials of the International had openly bragged that shippers, small creditors, and others who had claims against the International (approximately 260 damage suits against the road were pending) would get nothing. One of the attorneys for the small creditors kept his ears and eyes open, and being suspicious that Gould would make some sudden move in the courts, took particular care to be present at all proceedings. The Gould solicitors were not aware of Gould's motives; they were acting only on orders to secure judgment for a debt of the International to Gould. When the solicitor for the miscellaneous creditors, therefore, objected to the granting of the judgment and filed interventions, it was "like a clap of thunder out of a clear sky."[^23]

By a narrow margin, Gould thus missed his aim. The judge postponed the case for a number of days, thereby giving the Kansas & Texas the opportunity to marshal its forces for a fight against Gould. Inasmuch as the six months' grace period under the terms of the mortgage had not yet expired, the Kansas & Texas could, after assuming control of the property, pay the interest, discharge Gould's outstanding obligations, and thereby add the International to its own system. The Kansas & Texas called a shareholders' meeting for April first with a view of electing a new board. It now seemed that despite all Gould could do, the International was about to be lost to his railroad system.

Gould was again equal to the occasion. Through a new Texas friend he secured access to the state's attorney-general, who was informed that the International and Kansas & Texas were competitors, and that their control by a single interest would suppress competition. Gould's attorney, who communicated with the attorney-general, admitted later to a state investigating committee that while he had appealed to a public officer in the name of the state of Texas, he did not disclose the fact that he was aiming to promote private ends.[^24] Gould's plan was successful, and the shareholders' meeting of the International called by the Kansas & Texas was, upon application by the attorney-general, enjoined. Meanwhile, the state court in charge of the receivership, after an investigation into the validity of the Gould claim, had issued a judgment in his favor. Gould had again blocked the Kansas & Texas and prevented it from taking control of the International.

With the property of the Kansas & Texas in poor physical condition, with numerous parts of its main lines disconnected from each other, with no terminals on the northern and southern ends of its line, Gould could await developments. In reorganizing the property, the creditors, he could assume, would eventually come to him. It was generally expected that the road would remain part of the Missouri Pacific system. The weekly financial Gould critic, for example, observed that although the road was not absolutely essential to the Missouri Pacific, it was "hardly within the range of probabilities that no strong effort [would] be made to keep it within that system."[^25] About two years before when the road was still under control of the Missouri Pacific, Forbes of the Burlington remarked that in his opinion neither Gould nor his successor "when he is used up will let go their grip on it."[^26]

In his struggle to reacquire control, Gould originally paid little attention to the stock which had only a nominal value. Ahead of the stock were numerous high-interest-bearing bond issues. The liens were conflicting, and the loss of any part of the property secured by one bond might prove harmful to the property as a whole. The line north of Denison, due in part to the Gould policy of diverting business to the Missouri Pacific, had relatively little traffic. If the bondholders succeeded in their foreclosure proceedings and seized the northern lines, the section south of Denison would find the best resting place in Gould's southwestern net. Another group of bondholders held the lien on the southern and more productive part. Although the southern lines earned more than the northern, the bondholders nevertheless could not afford to lose the latter.

The weakness of the northern bondholders was such that they decided early in the fall of 1888, even before the company formally went into receivership, to trade with Gould. The Union Trust Company, on behalf of this group, submitted a plan to exchange three shares of Kansas & Texas for one share of Missouri Pacific, with the stock paying an assessment of $10 a share. Approximately $4,500,000 would be raised, of which $3,500,000 would finance the improvement of the road's physical condition, and the balance, aside from reorganization expenses, would be used to discharge the debt to the Missouri Pacific. The interest charges under the plan approximated $2,270,000.

Another plan submitted on behalf of the stockholders reduced the interest charges to $1,420,000 but set up a preferred stock, the dividend on which would call for the payment of more than $1,000,000. Gould opposed these as well as a number of other plans, primarily because they did not call for a sufficiently large reduction in prior charges ahead of the new common stock. Gould was ready to retransfer the road to the Missouri Pacific if the interest charges were reduced to a figure considerably less than $1,500,000. His scheme involved also the elimination of the common stock; but the stockholders and many bondholders opposed this feature on the ground that it would lead to endless litigation.

The Kansas & Texas management, meanwhile, assumed the aggressive by acquiring a Kansas City line, and this prompted Gould to change his mind about the importance of the stock. Even though the road was in receivership, he thought that with stock control he could stop the management from following policies detrimental to the interests of the Missouri Pacific. Since almost 50 per cent of the stock was held abroad, he sent an agent there to get proxies for the 1889 annual meeting. The president of the road, partly through overhearing a chance conversation, sent a competitive agent and, accordingly, both sailed for Europe on the same boat. The Dutch bondholders, remembering their experiences of 1879, did not repeat their mistake of succumbing to the lure of Gould's promises, and transferred their proxies to the existing management.[^27]

Gould underestimated the financial stamina of the stockholders. The stockholders' committee was a strong one. At its head was F. P. Olcott of the Central Trust Company, a leading competitor of the Gould-affiliated Mercantile Trust. On the Olcott committee was also Harry K. Enos, a representative of the Standard Oil Company, whose president and guiding genius was Rockefeller. The latter was a large holder of the securities of the Kansas & Texas, one source describing him as the largest holder.[^28] This was the first time that Gould encountered Rockefeller, and in this original contact Gould found himself outdistanced, outguessed, and outplayed. In the fall of 1889, in the midst of a series of claims and counterclaims from various security holders' committees, when the problems confronting the would-be organizers seemed almost to defy solution and when it appeared, in the language of one commentator, that "one of the most difficult problems in railroad organization that has ever appeared"[^29] was still far from a solution, the Olcott stockholders' committee, appeared suddenly in December of 1889 with an entirely new plan. It was a plan which only strong financial interests could carry out. At one stroke it solved the intricate problem posed by the conflict of interests between the northern and southern bondholding groups. The plan proposed to retire the northern division bonds, and to levy a 10 per cent assessment on the stock. This was Gould's original idea and both he and Sage enthusiastically supported the plan. Gould said that the plan had been suggested by him some years ago, and that if the proposed assessment had been accepted the cost of reorganization and receivership could have been avoided.[^30] The support given the plan by the Gould group led observers to express the thought that the road would soon be a part of the Missouri Pacific system. It was "pretty well understood" in Wall Street, reported one newspaper observer, that the road surely would be included as part of the Missouri Pacific,[^31] and Gould himself remarked categorically that the Kansas & Texas was "a natural ally of the Missouri Pacific."[^32] He therefore hastened his assurances and approval of the plan and, together with Sage and his associates, deposited his bonds in support of the plan.

Gould probably thought that upon failure of stockholders to pay the assessment he could get sufficient stock to control the company after reorganization. He did not apparently appreciate the financial power, the fixity of purpose, and the sound judgment of Rockefeller and his associates. A syndicate was organized to guarantee the subscription to more than $22,000,000 of new bonds to pay off the bonds on the northern division and to guarantee the payment of the assessment on the stock. The reorganization committee set up in the agreement had two Standard Oil men and one Gould man. The agreement provided that the committee should name the directors for two years. Even though Gould's interests were represented by only one of the six members of the committee, a well-informed financial journal remarked that it was "presumed, though not definitely stated, that there [was] to be some sort of alliance between the M. K. & T. and the Missouri Pacific."[^33]

Gould misconceived the powers behind the reorganization, just as the contemporary writer did. He did not, however, have to wait long before he was enlightened. At the next meeting of the board the Rockefeller representatives predominated, and Enos was elected president.[^34] At the next annual meeting in the spring of 1891, Rockefeller was elected to the board.

In the reorganization plan which thus elevated the Rockefeller interest to control, the fate of the International apparently had also been settled. It was agreed that the Kansas & Texas and the Missouri Pacific should each own one-half of the stock of the road, and that one-half of the judgment held by Gould against the road should be turned over to the Kansas & Texas. It was further agreed that the traffic relationships between the Missouri Pacific and the Kansas & Texas should be governed by a ten-year contract with the International to be operated jointly in the interests of the two controlling properties. When Gould learned later that the Kansas & Texas was no longer his and that, accordingly, the valuable traffic interchange between north and central Texas and Kansas City was lost, he resorted to his well-established method of respecting an agreement in letter but not in spirit. Late in February of 1890 at a time when Gould discovered the enormity of his error in believing that he had reacquired control of the Kansas & Texas, he bought at auction all except a few of the qualifying shares of the International. This was in accordance with the reorganization plan, although under the terms of the plan it was not essential for the sale to be conducted at such an early date. Gould moved fast to acquire control of the stock, the title to which, of course, was not entirely in his hands.

The reorganization plan providing for an assessment on the stock contained the conventional provision that if any shareholder did not pay the assessment, the committee or someone representing the committee could pay it and take up the stock. Gould in an effort to acquire control of the International decided to exploit the possibilities of this presumably innocent provision. The plan contained an expiration date, and in order to purchase the stock, a stockholder must have paid the assessment on a certain date. Gould had physical possession of the stock and on the very last day he delivered 50 per cent of the stock to the Kansas & Texas. The stock was deposited so late that it was impossible for the Kansas & Texas to deposit the money at the time stipulated in the plan of reorganization. Gould proposed, accordingly, to make a deposit adversely and thus get the stock for himself. The scheme was promptly challenged by the Kansas & Texas, and additional lawsuits were begun. The argument on this specialized technicality lasted all day before a judge in the state supreme court. An injunction was secured against all parties concerned. Rockefeller, however, was not interested in prolonging a technical lawsuit, and before the judge could hand down a decision, he reached a private settlement. All suits were withdrawn and the International stock was sold to the Missouri Pacific for one-half of Gould's judgment against the former road.[^35]

Despite numerous defensive measures, Gould failed to protect the western flank of his southwestern system. He had been forced to build parallel lines both in eastern Oklahoma and in southeastern Louisiana in order to carry traffic which had been lost through his failure to reacquire the Kansas & Texas. What was lost on the western part of the system was made up, however, at least in part, by another corporate trade on the eastern part.

One of the earliest competitors of the Gould lines on the traffic from Texas to the upper Mississippi Valley at St. Louis was the reorganized St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas, which under its new ownership was equally as aggressive as it had been prior to the reorganization. The company resumed the program of its corporate predecessor for the building of a road between St. Louis and Cairo. The management had attempted to induce the Burlington to build that extension to a connection with its own lines. To Perkins, however, the proposal was unattractive; ... "with all the other fish we have to fry at present, it was hardly worth our while to do so...." Perkins therefore suggested that the other road build the connection.[^36]

The management of the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas was in the hands of Colonel S. W. Fordyce—one of those personalities which have done so much to expand both the railroad and industrial plant of the country. When the road was reorganized in 1886 he was selected to operate the property by a committee clothed with authority to appoint the board for a period of five years. The company's treasury securities, consisting of second-mortgage bonds and stocks, proved unsalable. Fordyce decided nevertheless to improve the property, and in order to buy steel rails and other equipment, placed his personal endorsement on more than $3,000,000 of corporate paper. The paper was held by Carnegie.[^37]

Fordyce probably believed that the prosperity of 1886 and 1887, to which the construction activities of the western railroads contributed, would last for some years. He therefore decided that he would be able to sell securities in amounts sufficient to meet the Carnegie obligation. Although the traffic of the road increased, the profits did not. The extensions, both actual and proposed, into the Gould territory, led to a war of rates, and both the earnings of the Gould roads and of this road were adversely affected. As November, 1888, approached, Fordyce recognized that he would have insufficient funds to meet the road's interest. Despite the money already spent on improvements, some parts of the line were still in poor physical condition; and in order to place the road in working order, from two to three million of additional cash was needed. The company's financial condition in the fall of 1888 became so serious that for a while the company could not meet its current pay roll.[^38]

Fordyce, although an able operating man, was helpless. He was in a corner and sought a way out to relieve himself of his personal financial obligations; and the logical candidate for the position of reliever was Gould. Gould had long desired to acquire control, though there was no necessity for acting quickly to save the property from a trunk-line competitor. He could bide his time, and in the fall of 1888 the critical moment arrived. Fordyce in negotiating with Gould possessed precisely what Gould wanted. He had some junior securities which gave the holder the right to control a majority of the members of the board of directors. Gould bought the junior securities, thus giving the company sufficient money to pay its interest, liquidate its floating debt, and make improvements. Sage, Gould's son George, and Louis Fitzgerald, president of the Gould affiliated Mercantile Trust, were elected to the managerial committee. The rate war between the Gould system and the purchased road came to a quick end. The latter stopped work on the St. Louis extension, and arranged to use the line of the Iron Mountain for an entrance into St. Louis. The Gould purchase was a great stroke for the Missouri Pacific, substantially increasing its competitive strength.

On the face of things the first mortgage bondholders of the company were not interested in the managerial change, and they therefore ignored the new acquisition. Perhaps they might even have been pleased since the passage of control provided sufficient funds for the payment of the November, 1888, coupon, which in the absence of the new control might not have been paid. In this feeling of confidence they were mistaken. There was plenty of experience which should have taught them the unwisdom of closing their eyes to change in control, if the change was effected by a man who had shown his knowledge and ability in taking full advantage of any opening offered to reduce the capital charges ahead of his holdings of junior securities. The first mortgage coupon was due in May, 1889. The trustee was the Central Trust Company, headed by Olcott, who was then serving as chairman of a group of junior security holders of the Kansas & Texas. The Central Trust, under the provisions of the first mortgage, had issued some peculiar coupon-bearing certificates which were obligations against itself as trustee. Upon his assumption of control, Gould appointed the Mercantile Trust Company as the road's fiscal agent. He now repeated the financial device which he had used some years before on the Texas & Pacific. The Mercantile Trust honored the first mortgage interest coupons in cash; but the coupons, instead of being canceled as received, were held alive. In the hands of the trust company, representing some Gould interest, the coupons served as a lien against the railroad company. After about $140,000 out of a total of $490,000 was paid, the Central Trust refused to recognize as obligations any coupons held by the Mercantile Trust.

By making this small payment, Gould apparently planned to place himself again in one of those strategic positions which were so dear to him. In addition to involving the Central Trust which, in connection with the Kansas & Texas activities, was blocking his efforts to reacquire control of that road, Gould was also actuated by the desire to reduce the interest rate on the first mortgage bonds of the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas. His persistent critics were surprised, as they had so often been before, at the ease with which he played the same game over and over to a new and inexperienced audience. His weekly financial critic which had persistently assailed him for a score of years renewed its attack in an interesting editorial entitled "A New Tale With an Old Moral." "To be fooled once or even twice by a certain set of circumstances," it asserted, "does not argue perhaps a lack of sagacity; but to be fooled over and over again by the same conjunction of facts subjects one at least to a charge of infatuation."[^39]

The Central Trust Company, in view of its potential liability under the first mortgage of the road, acted promptly. Within a few days it moved for a receiver, and the application was granted. The large German bondholdings were represented by a committee representing leading American financial institutions.

Gould, as usual, found any number of strategically sound arguments to bolster his position that the first mortgage bondholders of the company should and must accept some sacrifice in the form of a reduction of interest. He discovered that the first mortgage bond, like the Wabash general mortgage bond of 1880, was protected by a lien which did not cover the entire system.
