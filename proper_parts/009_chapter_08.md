## Chapter VIII - Gould Utilizes the Union Pacific

Gould in the spring of 1875 occupied a unique position in the railroad and financial life of the country. For a relatively small price he had secured working control of the eastern part of the transcontinental railroad—the Union Pacific. He had acquired the stock toward the end of the stock-market boom, and despite his heavy paper losses, he was able by judicious trading to maintain his financial position sufficiently to enable him to retain his stock. Unlike Huntington, he did not have the extensive support of banks and of dividends on his stock. Furthermore, the road whose control he held so carefully throughout the panic days had been acquired and lost by three dominant financial groups on the eastern seaboard.

The Union Pacific was now prosperous; its floating debt was paid, and its pressing bond maturities removed. With his control of the New York-San Francisco water line, and the eastern link of the transcontinental rail route, he dominated the rate structure. In this regard, observed Huntington, he had "a power equal to the control of the whole link."^1 Gould, as the largest stockholder, could now become an investor and reap the fruits of his activities. He was not, however, prepared to play the role of a passive investor.

The main avenues for financial and corporate strategy aside from the Union Pacific itself lay, first, in the independent Kansas Pacific and its controlled line in Colorado, second, in the contractual relations between the dominant Western Union Telegraph and the transcontinental railroads, and third, in the competitive coast-to-coast water-transportation service.

The Kansas Pacific in the spring of 1875 had fallen into financial difficulties. Shortly after the panic of 1873 the company had confessed its inability to meet its interest charges. In the spring of 1874 an arrangement was made by which the unpaid interest was funded into long-term bonds. Despite its financial weakness the Kansas Pacific was a valuable property. It had adequate terminals, both in Denver and in Kansas City. It served a rich agricultural territory in central Kansas. At Kansas City it connected with a group of roads with which it formed through routes to St. Louis and beyond. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, the Denver Pacific, it connected with the Union Pacific's main line at Cheyenne. The Union Pacific refused to grant rates to and from points west of Cheyenne that would enable the Kansas Pacific to participate in the business. This was apparently in violation of the Act of 1864 which required the Union Pacific to charge the same rate per mile on traffic interchanged with its competitive connections (including the Kansas Pacific) that it charged on its own business. This the Union Pacific declined to do.

The Kansas Pacific and the Union Pacific were active competitors. The Union Pacific moved its business over its line to Omaha. The Kansas Pacific endeavored unsuccessfully to move some Pacific Coast business over its line via Kansas City for interchange with the Union Pacific at Cheyenne. The Union Pacific furthermore controlled the Colorado Central which owned a small line from Denver north to Longmont. The Union Pacific by completing this line north to Cheyenne could compete actively with the Kansas Pacific for local Colorado traffic.

It would be in the interest of both roads to co-operate in order to remove this competition. Gould early in 1875 therefore worked out an apparent solution. A new company was to be organized, to control both the Union Pacific and the Kansas Pacific. One-half of the stock would be issued to persons named by the Union Pacific, and the other half to be exchanged for the stock of the Kansas Pacific.^2 This scheme soon collapsed and a rate war followed.

The war brought the Kansas Pacific a large volume of business from eastern Colorado, and from some points on the main line of the Union Pacific. To hold its long-haul traffic to its main line to Omaha, the latter had to meet the rate cuts of the Kansas Pacific. On through business moving beyond its own line at Omaha it could not readily do so since at that point it traded with three well-managed properties: the Northwestern, the Chicago Rock Island & Pacific,^3 and the Burlington. Shortly after the completion of the transcontinental line, these three roads connecting Omaha with Chicago formed the famous Iowa Pool for the handling of the Union Pacific traffic. The pool was the envy of the railroad world. The lines divided the through business in accordance with agreements that in the 1870s were generally observed.

Neither the Northwestern (aside from some common holdings by leading shareholders in a small trans-river road) nor the Rock Island had any interest in lines west of the Missouri River and did not therefore compete for traffic with the Union Pacific. Since the Burlington also terminated at the river, it similarly offered no competition. Members of its board, however, owned most of the stock of the Burlington & Missouri River in Nebraska,^4 and also served on its board. This road, serving southern Nebraska paralleling the Union Pacific and connecting with it at Kearney, was a valuable feeder of the Burlington. The bulk of its traffic moved to points east of the Missouri River and could be traded with the Burlington at E. Plattsmouth, Nebraska, a few miles below Omaha—the point of interchange between the Union Pacific and the Burlington. The latter gave the B. & M. a drawback on all business, and almost all of its eastbound traffic accordingly flowed over the Burlington. In addition to its local business the B. & M. wanted a share of the transcontinental traffic, and it therefore insisted that the Union Pacific quote similar rates on traffic of both roads moving either over the B. & M. via Kearney, or over the Union Pacific via Omaha. This the Union Pacific declined to do. The Pacific Railroad Acts, however, anticipated competition and not monopoly. Hence, the B. & M. in co-operation with the Kansas Pacific, supported a bill in Congress—the so-called pro-rata bill—to compel the Union Pacific to charge the same mileage rates for traffic of all roads moving over its lines. Under such conditions, traffic would flow east from Kearney to Omaha over the Union Pacific or to Plattsmouth over the B. & M.; and also east over the Kansas Pacific via Cheyenne, and the Denver Pacific to Kansas City.

Gould transformed the local struggle in southern Nebraska into one of larger proportions. Despite the fact that the Burlington traded on a friendly basis with the Union Pacific at Omaha, it, so argued Gould, endorsed the pro-rata bill. According to Gould, the Burlington was thus supporting a measure designed to reduce the volume of business interchanged between it and the Union Pacific in order to increase the volume it interchanged with the B. & M. The Union Pacific and the Burlington had always been friends—so ran the Gould argument—but that friendship was no longer dependable. "With one hand we are offered friendship and peace; and with the other Enmity and War."^5 Although this was not Gould's language, it reflected his views. Gould, by holding the Burlington responsible for the policies of the B. & M., charged that it was reducing the business of the Iowa Pool lines. He thus paved the way for the development of adverse interests between the Burlington on one hand, and the Rock Island and the Northwestern on the other.

The Burlington denied Gould's contention, insisting that it neither controlled the B. & M. nor had anything to do with the pro-rata bill. The B. & M. refused to back down. Its general manager, Charles E. Perkins—a man destined to assume the leadership against Gould in western territory—never flinched. The struggle between them exerted an outstanding influence on the growth of the West. Perkins refused to be upset by Gould's threats to force the Burlington to break up the traffic arrangement with his road. Nothing, he wrote, "nothing but cold cash" could induce his road not to exhaust its legal remedies. His road, and not the Union Pacific, was the injured party, and had his road been properly treated the pro-rata bill would never have been proposed. Perkins, through an intermediary, advised Robert Harris, president of the Burlington, to write the Union Pacific a good stiff letter. Such a letter would "do more to maintain friendly relations than any show of weakness."^6

In the midst of this struggle over the pro-rata bill the relative position of the two major contestants was suddenly changed. Taking advantage of a sharp break in the stock market early in 1877, Gould purchased large blocks of the shares of both the Northwestern and the Rock Island. He believed that by buying these stocks he could separate the business interests of these two roads, members of the Iowa Pool, from those of the remaining member, the Burlington. At the annual meetings of the Northwestern and the Rock Island shortly thereafter, Gould and two of the Union Pacific board members (Dillon and Oliver Ames) went on the boards of both roads; while three of the board members of the Rock Island and Northwestern joined the board of the Union Pacific.

Gould understood that trading at Omaha with the Iowa Pool lines was essential to the welfare of the Union Pacific, and the conviction grew upon him that in order to depress the Omaha-Chicago rate structure, it was necessary to break up the Iowa Pool. Of the Pool roads, the Burlington was the only one that competed with the Union Pacific in Nebraska—through the medium of the B. & M. To exert pressure on the Burlington, Gould had to deal with two strikingly different personalities. The president of the Burlington was Harris, a temperamental compromiser. His business philosophy was best expressed in his own language. In a letter to Schuyler Colfax, vice president of the United States during Grant's administration, he described himself as an opponent of rate wars. On "throat-cutting," as applied to railroads, he wrote, "count me out first, last and always. I object to murder in all its forms and especially to suicide, and appreciate the military maxim:

'He who fights and runs away
Lives to fight another day.'"^7

Harris was inclined to be timid and was frequently ready to compromise a position in advance, even before he was attacked. He saw the attack coming, but instead of preparing a defense he devised a compromise.

Perkins, the other leader of the Burlington camp, had an iron backbone. Gould's threats had little effect upon him. Both in public utterances and in private communications he defied Gould's dire warnings, referring to them frequently as "bulldozing."

Shortly after his election to the Northwestern and Rock Island directorates, Gould left for New York, and early in April he met with the representatives of the B. & M. and of the three Iowa Pool roads. There he proposed to settle the open questions between the Union Pacific, the B. & M. and the three Iowa roads in one grand all-embracing transaction, to be known as the Quintuple Contract. The B. & M. would surrender its demands for interchange with the Union Pacific, and both would agree not to extend their lines in competitive territory until 1884 without a mutual understanding. The traffic of the B. & M., Gould further proposed, should be divided among the three Iowa roads. This was another of Gould's gestures. It was a specious proposal which had all the elements of fairness. He probably knew that at the proper time he could observe the letter of agreement and yet destroy its spirit.

The proposals appealed to Harris, and during the next few days in May and June he evolved one compromise after another. While they did credit to his ingenuity, they showed clearly his fear of Gould's tactics. He was certain that the Northwestern would yield to the Gould pressure, and that this road in conjunction with the Rock Island would break up the Iowa Pool. "All my action," wrote Harris, "is based upon this idea."^8

The views of Harris influenced the Burlington's board, and on April 13 Harris and Perkins were instructed to prepare a financial and traffic report. Harris carried on extensive negotiations with officers of the other two Iowa lines. Many proposals were made, amended and later rejected. Harris stressed his fears of the possible losses to the Burlington and insisted that the B. & M. should not endanger the pool.

Perkins, however, would make no concessions on behalf of the Nebraska. It is not certain that this opposition alone would have defeated the Quintuple Contract. Gould, however, by a tactical trading blunder helped Perkins, overreaching himself in trading, as he so often did. Gould induced Dillon, president of the Union Pacific, to route some of its traffic via the Missouri Valley lines. From Council Bluffs south to St. Joseph and Kansas City extended the line of the Kansas City St. Joseph & Council Bluffs.^9 East from St. Joseph to Quincy at the Mississippi River was the Hannibal, and that road connected in turn with the Wabash which owned a line to Toledo. "A very large portion" of the Union Pacific's eastbound business was diverted to this route, for the purpose of affecting the Quintuple negotiations.^10 An official of the Rock Island who learned of this was thereby convinced that the Quintuple Contract would not incline the Union Pacific to give the Iowa roads any practical advantages. This opinion was shared by Harris of the Burlington.^11

Slightly more than a month later the Northwestern and the Rock Island abandoned further negotiations for the signing of the Quintuple. The Iowa Pool was saved. Perkins's stand was justified, and his views served as a precedent to guide subsequent corporate conflicts between the Burlington and Gould.

Gould had lost his fight to break up the Iowa Pool—and it was the Burlington that had defeated him. Gould, however, did not long remain quiet under the sting of this defeat. Even while the Quintuple negotiations were in progress, he had moved south to deliver a blow on the Burlington's flank. The Burlington's lines in southern Iowa terminated on the west at E. Plattsmouth, Nebraska, where connection was made with the B. & M. The Burlington over its own lines did not reach Kansas City, the gateway to the rapidly expanding Southwest. The direct connection for the Burlington's business between the Mississippi River and Kansas City was the Hannibal, which gave access also to St. Joseph—another lucrative traffic-producing center. In 1877 the Boston interest, including a number of Burlington directors, sold out their stock control to the Tweed-Sweeny group. Nevertheless the Burlington's officers were confident that the management of the Hannibal was friendly and would continue to be so. The Hannibal in fact could not afford to be otherwise, since the Burlington's connection was "worth more than any other or all others" the Hannibal could make.^12

The Burlington had an opportunity in the middle seventies to acquire control of the road at a low price. Some officials favored the acquisition, while others, including the president, opposed it. The road, though financially weak, was of strategic value not only to the Burlington but also to other lines. Gould made a spectacular bid for control of the road, but at the last moment a group of wary stockholders beat him.

The struggle to outflank the Burlington by the capture of the Hannibal involved a simultaneous effort to acquire control of the Kansas Pacific connecting with the Hannibal at Kansas City. With the Kansas Pacific and the Union Pacific under common control, traffic could be diverted to the Kansas City route, and away from the Iowa lines at Omaha. The Kansas Pacific, freed from Union Pacific control, could be bought either by the Atchison or the Burlington. The latter could connect with the Kansas Pacific at Kansas City either by buying an existing road between Omaha and Kansas City, by acquiring the Hannibal, or by building a new line. The Atchison of course joined the Kansas Pacific at Kansas City.

The finances of the Kansas Pacific meanwhile had taken a turn for the worse. The company had been unable to meet its interest payments on the funded coupons and in December of 1876 a receivership followed. Two receivers were appointed; one, Carlos Greeley, was the road's second largest stockholder and also held a large part of the floating debt. The other was Henry Villard. He represented the German bondholders of the Kansas Pacific. In October of 1873 he had been elected a member of the Committee of Bondholders, and early in 1874 had returned in that capacity to the United States. He had been a Civil War journalist, had dabbled a little in financial matters and by this time had enlisted the confidence of German investors and large German financial institutions. Villard as receiver acted in a twofold capacity. He administered the road's affairs as receiver and looked after the interests of the bondholders as a member and later as chairman of a bondholders' committee of nine.

Greeley represented the holders of the bonds secured by a mortgage on the Eastern Division, while Villard represented chiefly the holders of the bonds secured by a mortgage on the western end—known generally as the Denver extension.

Financially, possibilities fitted in well with Gould's unique temperament. Most of the funds needed to build the road had been furnished by the bondholders. A floating debt, substantial enough though small in comparison with the sums furnished by the bondholders, was held largely by the road's directors. Gould perceived an opportunity of using a bit of money to facilitate control of a property in which others—the bondholders—had invested much more. A little money at the right time and in the right place could go a long way in the hands of an astute trader. And Gould could certainly qualify. To take care of the floating debt Gould worked out a Funding mortgage. This suggestion was accepted by the board of directors in exchange for a promise by Gould, Oliver Ames and the Union Pacific to relieve the directors, if there was any default on the first mortgage bonds, of a large portion of their personal liability for the floating debt. The Funding mortgage was secured by collateral including the stock of the Denver Pacific.^13 Upon default of the Funding mortgage, the Union Pacific could take control of the Denver Pacific and thus eliminate the Kansas Pacific's ability to compete with the Union Pacific on Pacific Coast traffic. Thus, Gould with no proprietary interest in the Kansas Pacific secured a strategic position in its affairs. Gould also made short-term advances to the Kansas Pacific secured by notes maturing in February of 1877. Furthermore, the sharp decline in the prices of Kansas Pacific securities afforded Gould the opportunity to buy at exceptionally low prices. For some of the income bonds, for example, he paid only about twelve cents on the dollar.^14

Gould soon thereafter entered into a struggle to acquire control of the Kansas Pacific through his ownership of part of the floating debt, part of the Funding mortgage, and a substantial block of the road's junior securities. These latter he acquired in the open market. Villard was his major opponent. He represented the interests of the first mortgage bondholders. Gould's devious shifts and successive trades and proposals were met by the firm insistence of Villard that the bondholders' interests must be protected. In order to force Villard to settle on his own terms Gould exerted pressure in a number of directions. In the fall of 1877 a contract was signed with the Iowa Pool lines to encourage the movement of business via Omaha and away from the Kansas Pacific line. This contract was made, according to Villard, "preparatory to a desperate raid on our (Kansas Pacific) Colorado business...."^15 Gould also threatened to move all the Colorado business the Union Pacific could control east to Kansas City via the Atchison. Gould next completed the unfinished line of the Colorado Central from Longmont to Cheyenne, thereby completing for the Union Pacific a through Denver-Omaha route competing with the Denver-Kansas City line of the Kansas Pacific. Soon after the completion of this connection a profitable bullion traffic which had moved east over the Kansas Pacific was diverted to the Union Pacific.^16

The immediate result was a rate war on Colorado business. Chicago-Denver rates fell so low that the Union Pacific carried through freight from Omaha to Cheyenne destined to Denver for one mill per ton mile, as compared with the local rate of from twelve to eighteen times that amount.^17

Villard, as leader of the mortgage bondholders, fought back. He went ahead with plans to foreclose the Denver Extension mortgage. Had this been carried out Gould's investment in the junior securities of the road would have been worth very little. Villard, furthermore, made a strong effort to interest officials and large holders of the securities of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe^18 and the Burlington to co-operate with him in acquiring control of the Kansas Pacific. William Endicott, a wealthy capitalist of Boston, Forbes of the Burlington, T. H. Nickerson, president of the Atchison, were among those whom Villard approached. These and a number of their followers bought some of the mortgage bonds of the Kansas Pacific and promised support to Villard in reorganizing the road. Early in 1878 Villard had already devised a plan of reorganization involving foreclosure and the elimination of Gould's junior holdings as part of a decision "to fight Gould to the last." Forbes was impressed by the prospect of a successful reorganization thereby strengthening a competitor of the Union Pacific. Beyond offering prayers for Villard's success, and the purchase of a relatively small amount of Kansas Pacific first mortgage bonds, Forbes was not prepared to go.

Villard had one more piece of ammunition with which to fight Gould. He announced his determination to press forward with his effort to push through Congress the so-called pro-rata bill. This would have forced the Union Pacific to make such rates as would have enabled both the B. & M. via Kearney and the Kansas Pacific via Cheyenne to obtain a part of the transcontinental business. The Union Pacific would lose, and the Kansas Pacific and the B. & M. would gain.

Meanwhile Gould and Dillon approached Villard in an effort to enter into negotiations in order to reach a solution on the outstanding problems between the two roads. One agreement had been made in the summer of 1877; but this did not last long. Villard and his chief associates refused to negotiate. "It is clear to my mind that we can have no more agreements with Gould, because we cannot believe anything he says,"^19 wrote one of Villard's chief negotiators. Gould, according to Villard, was furious over Villard's refusal to negotiate. He finally responded to this sturdy defense of Villard by applying to the court to dismiss him as a receiver. Late in 1877 the court discharged both Villard and Greeley as receivers. Gould meanwhile intensified the rate war. The Union Pacific, wrote Villard in February of 1878, "seems to be now making war on us in earnest."^20

By the spring of 1878 Gould and his associates—a number from St. Louis—had bought heavily of the junior securities of the Kansas Pacific. Villard meanwhile had induced many investors both in this country and Germany to invest substantial sums in the first mortgage bonds. In order to unify the interests of the holders of the junior securities, Gould conceived the idea of pooling their holdings. Gould, furthermore, convinced Villard that in order to harmonize the interests of the junior and senior securities, he should join the committee administering the pool. The pool was formed in April, 1878. The holdings of the junior security holders were exchanged for the stock of the pool. The precise plan for the exchange of these securities as published by the Pacific Railway Commission was as follows:

Plan for the Exchange of Kansas Pacific^21
Junior Securities for Stock of the Pool

| Securities of Existing Kansas Pacific | Par Value of Existing Securities | Rate of Exchange | To Be Received in New Stock |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| Stock                               | $9,600,000                   | 12½%           | $1,200,000                |

| Leavenworth branch bonds            | 630,000                      | 50%            | 315,000                   |
| **Total**                           | **$17,330,350**              |                | **$4,855,350**            |

Following the organization of the pool, Gould entered into active negotiations to reorganize the road. In consideration of Villard's agreement to join the pool, Gould on behalf of the Kansas Pacific, since he owned the largest part of the pooled securities, offered Villard a plan of reorganization, favorable to his clients. Gould, however, exacted a price. He agreed to make these concessions only in consideration of an arrangement by which the management of the road would be placed under Union Pacific officers. Only in this way could the war between the two lines in the courts and in the marts of business be settled, their relations harmonized, and the rates restored to profitable levels.

Gould had long bargained with Villard, who had made few and insubstantial concessions. Gould could wait no longer. The Kansas Pacific in the spring of 1878 was in financial trouble. A large amount of its notes were indorsed personally by members of the board and assumed by the Union Pacific, so that the Union Pacific in effect saved the junior security holders of the Kansas Pacific. Gould and his associates on the boards of both the Kansas Pacific and the Union Pacific used the credit of the strong Union Pacific to sustain the financial life of the Kansas Pacific in the junior securities of which Gould and his group had a large interest.

The Kansas Pacific, furthermore, was renewing its pressure in both the halls of Congress and the judicial chambers to force the Union Pacific to trade with it on fair and equitable terms. There appeared to be reasonable prospects that the Union Pacific would be required to reduce its rates on business carried for the other line. In the winter of 1877-78 Congress appeared determined to compel the Union Pacific to interchange business with the Kansas Pacific on a non-discriminatory basis. It was not clear, however, which road would gain. Legal compulsion on the Union Pacific might bring about an even more intensified warfare. The sensible business solution would be a union of interests, a communion of management, the elimination of rate wars, and a permanent restoration of the rate structure.

The concessions Gould gave to Villard enabled him to take steps toward his final goal. Once having cleared the way by his agreement with Villard, he moved with his customary energy and decision. He drew up a contract for a union of the two roads and their respective Colorado subsidiaries—the Colorado Central and the Denver Pacific. These properties, together with the Omaha Bridge which connected Omaha and Council Bluffs on the eastern end of the Union Pacific, were placed "under the general direction of the Union Pacific," to "be managed, operated and controlled as one property."^22 It was a remarkable business contract, embracing the largest pool ever proposed west of the Mississippi River covering nearly 2,000 miles of road, and under the terms of which the revenue of all the lines was consigned to a common fund. The contract was followed shortly by a rearrangement of the directorate of the Kansas Pacific. The new board included largely the holders of the common stock and junior debt securities.

The agreement was concluded early in June. On June 20, Gould held a secret meeting of the representatives of the Pool of the road's junior securities. Villard was not present at this meeting. At that meeting the group arranged to press forward with a foreclosure suit under the terms of the Income mortgage. Villard discovered this move almost immediately. This effort constituted a violation of the pooling contract. The break between Villard and Gould was again renewed. Gould, wrote Villard, is "again going back on us... he and the rascally St. Louis people,... had formed a regular conspiracy in the west to break the contract and cheat the bondholders."^23

A long and desperate struggle between the two opponents followed. It went on for months. Gould fought to acquire control of the Kansas Pacific through the junior securities. Villard was insistent upon reorganizing the road in the interests of the first mortgage bondholders. "We, that is the bondholders, are trying to overcome Gould, & Gould is trying to overcome us,"^24 declared Villard. Villard moved quickly to secure control of a majority of the Denver Extension mortgage bonds. Through New York and German bankers he succeeded in securing the deposit with his committee of a substantial percentage of the bonds. The bonds were deposited with Villard's committee of nine and exchanged for certificates of interest. He then instructed counsel to press for foreclosure. He also renewed his efforts to induce the Atchison and the Burlington to co-operate with him in controlling the Kansas Pacific. Alternatively as another possibility he endeavored to bring the Kansas Pacific and the Atchison under one control. He also considered plans of building a connection between Denver and Ogden, thereby using the threat which Gould so successfully utilized only a year later in forcing the Union Pacific to acquire the Kansas Pacific on Gould's terms.

Gould now proposed to buy the Extension bonds deposited with the Villard committee at prices substantially below par. Having thus secured the bonds, Gould would control the foreclosure sale and acquire the property. Villard was furious. His language was reminiscent of the palmy days of the Erie. Gould, according to Villard, was faithless. No longer could he place "implicit trust in an associate who had so betrayed his confidence." His committee meanwhile went ahead with its plans for foreclosure, and by late August was able to arrange for the selection of a purchasing committee to buy the road at the foreclosure sale. The majority of the bonds had already approved the plan.

Villard, even though no longer a receiver of the Kansas Pacific, enjoyed the confidence and loyalty of the bondholders. He had defeated Gould. He had defeated a combination to exclude them from the management of the property and to turn it over to the junior security holders. Gould on the other hand was patient and he decided, if possible, to outwit, outwait and outbargain the Villard followers. Since, despite the removal of Villard as a receiver, the Denver Extension group proceeded with its plans to foreclose the property and thus to take control, Gould decided to make another proposal. He offered to merge the Union Pacific with the Kansas Pacific, but this was forthwith rejected by Villard.

The Villard group meanwhile went ahead with its plans. At a bondholders' meeting, a committee of three submitted a plan of reorganization. The plan would give control to Villard's Denver Extension bondholders. Toward the end of 1878 it seemed probable that Gould would lose his long battle over the control of the Kansas Pacific.

While he was thus struggling with these land-transcontinental problems, he could not afford to lose his interest in the water route, via the Isthmus of Panama. Indeed, when he assumed control of the Union Pacific in the spring of 1874, this problem seemed to be of paramount importance. The Panama route by aggressive rate-cutting could divert the Orient and the Central and South American traffic from the overland route. It could also attract business between the two coasts, and in view of the war of rates which perennially raged in the eastern trunk-line territory, especially on eastbound business, it was possible to attract business to the water route at points as far inland from the Atlantic coast as Chicago and St. Louis. In order to meet competition the transcontinental railroads were compelled to reduce through rates.

Gould in the spring of 1875 had apparently solved this problem by acquiring control at a low price of the competitive water route. Through interlocking directorates between the Union Pacific and the Pacific Mail, it appeared within the power of Gould and his group to maintain rates and to guide the flow of traffic either on rail or on water as considerations of profit might indicate. In carrying out his plans, however, Gould soon encountered the physically tiny but financially powerful Panama Railroad, operating a line across Panama, thereby serving as a link in a transcontinental water-rail-water route.

Early in 1875 at the annual meeting of the Panama road, the board representatives of the Pacific Mail were dropped. Park, the fiery midget of Vermont and California, was elected president, and the war between the Panama Railroad and the Pacific Mail-Union Pacific combination began almost immediately. After the election of the new board, a resolution was passed that after the end of ninety days, the present contract regulating the division of profits with the Pacific Mail, made late in 1874, be abrogated. The Pacific Mail on its side, to add to the bitterness of the conflict, notified the Panama that it would waive the ninety days' notice required for cancellation and that it would immediately ship oriental traffic over the overland railroad. The Panama Railroad thereupon threatened to organize a rival steamship line. Whereupon the vice president of the Pacific Mail declared that a new steamship line would not take in sufficient revenue to pay the wages of the engineers.

A rate war seemed inevitable. Yet before the end of the month a basis of settlement was apparently reached with the Union Pacific. This contract, according to one source, meant that any rates between the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, not prohibitory, could be charged. It was soon discovered, however, that the contract did not cover the unfortunate Pacific Mail. "It is hardly credible," said one journalistic observer, "that this line has been slaughtered, as it is understood that a majority of the stock is in the same control as the railroads."^25 The price of Pacific Mail dropped. Gould was primarily interested in Union Pacific, his financial stake in its stock being uppermost in his mind. He was, therefore, willing to subordinate the Pacific Mail in which he had a small commitment, to the Union Pacific in which he had a large one.

Soon, however, trouble developed. Within two weeks negotiations were discontinued. Gould insisted that the rail-water route carry bulky traffic, and that the land route carry the lighter more valuable traffic. Park, on behalf of the Panama Railroad, was adamant in the support of his stand. He was not prepared, he said, to let Gould manage the Pacific Mail-Union Pacific combination and leave the Panama road with only the low-class, relatively low-profit business.^26

Gould was not ready to make terms with Park. Although he had had some trading and speculative experience with Park, he had not tested him in the industrial world. Gould, far from proposing any settlement, announced that he was ready for a war on the Panama Railroad, and threatened to initiate court proceedings against the property because of certain alleged charter violations which had been publicly spread many years before. The Pacific Mail stock continued to drop and early in June reached a low of 32. A few weeks later Gould, twisting another screw in order to gain better terms from Park, negotiated a contract between the two transcontinental railroads (the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific) and the two steamship companies (the Pacific Mail and the Occidental & Oriental Steamship Company). The steamship lines operating in conjunction with the railroads would offer alternative service between New York City and the Orient; and each line would get an annual subsidy from foreign governments. The railroads would guarantee the Pacific Mail's ships 600 tons of freight semi-monthly.^27

Park however would not budge, while Gould, on behalf of the Union Pacific and the Pacific Mail, continued to negotiate. Early in September another transaction was announced. This time it was a five-year contract by which the business was to be divided between the transcontinental railroads and the Panama Railroad. Of the California business, the Panama would get one-fourth, and of the Central American business, one-third.^28

This agreement, like so many others publicly announced with many flourishes, was never approved. These announcements were usually followed by significant movements in the prices of the Pacific Mail. It is probable that both sides were buying and selling Pacific Mail in a response to their knowledge of the negotiations. From month to month the speculative interest in Pacific Mail was maintained. On October 19, on a report that the Pacific Mail had sold some ships for $700,000, the stock moved up over two points on a volume which represented almost 50 per cent of the total trading on that day. In the following three days on reports of a favorable financial statement submitted to the board of directors, but not yet made public, the stock in heavy trading advanced another three points.

In November of 1875 these negotiations came to an abrupt halt, and the price of Pacific Mail stock dropped again. At about the same time the directors of the Panama appointed a committee to provide ships in order to engage in business between New York and San Francisco, and between Panama and Central America, and authorized also the issue of $4,000,000 of bonds to raise the necessary funds.^29 According to one story, published many years after the event, by an observer who had apparently unusual sources of information, Park is said to have sold 60,000 shares of Pacific Mail short in anticipation of the injury which a Panama-controlled steamship service would inflict upon the Pacific Mail.^30

The Pacific Mail (Gould, of course) immediately applied for an injunction to restrain the Panama Railroad from entering the steamship business. Though the injunction was granted, the Panama company was firm. Recognizing that the Pacific Mail was not independent, it was determined to break the connection with the Union Pacific.

Although Gould succeeded in enjoining the operation of the steamship service by the Panama, he had in reality accomplished little. Informed observers soon became aware of the likelihood that Park could legally carry out his purposes by operating the service through a separate company. In mid-March Park announced that the new company, the Panama Transit Steamship, would have its first ship ready by the first of April. A price war between the two steamship companies followed. The Pacific Mail lost heavily and in May, 1876, at the time of the annual meeting, the company was faced with impending bankruptcy. Gould had promised a year before to solve its financial problems. Now he took no interest in the company. He did not even attend the board meetings and made no plans and offered no suggestions to remedy conditions. Recognizing that Park would make no concessions, he saw clearly thatHere's the continuation of the formatted chapter:

---

Gould therefore quietly allowed, and perhaps encouraged, the Pacific Mail to increase its debts. At the annual meeting held soon thereafter, Gould and his group were ousted, and Park and his group elected. The Gould venture in the Pacific Mail was, therefore, a failure.

In his moves to dominate the Pacific Mail and the Kansas Pacific and to bring the Burlington to terms, Gould dealt with established companies and with well-known relationships. He dealt with railroads or with competitors of railroads, with properties which exerted a definite influence on the business life of the Union Pacific, in which his interests mainly rested. There was sound basis for his agreements with railroads and steamships, and there was general expectation in informed quarters that to promote the welfare of the Union Pacific, such moves were essential.

However, few expected Gould to use his connections with the Union Pacific to make his entry into the telegraph business and to challenge that imposing telegraph citadel, the Western Union Telegraph Company.^31 His attack on the powerful telegraph monopoly was made with a small, almost insignificant competitor—the Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company.^32

In the competitive race in the telegraph business, the Western Union by the middle sixties had secured a dominant role. Its pre-eminence was due in part to its foresight in negotiating railroad contracts. To the railroads, telegraph service was indispensable. For financial and other reasons, however, they hesitated to build their own lines, and so as a general rule they owned little telegraph property. In February, 1879, for example, it was reliably declared that less than half a dozen railroads owned any wires.^33

Although competition was open to all comers, the Western Union succeeded in getting most of the railroad contracts. Having made a contract with the Western Union, a railroad was not permitted to make a contract with any other telegraph company. Among the few properties which were obliged by law to do their own telegraph business were the Pacific railroads.

The Union Pacific, like most of the roads, soon found that it had plenty of railroad problems to settle without trying to master the telegraph business. Early in its history, accordingly, it took advantage of an opportunity to get out of this business. A small rival of the Western Union—the Atlantic & Pacific—established a line from Chicago to Omaha. In order to serve the region west from that point, it purchased the line of the Union Pacific for 24,000 shares of the Atlantic & Pacific stock—stock which had been sold at ten cents on the dollar.^34 Soon afterward the company made contracts with the Huntington road for service to the coast.^35

To the Atlantic & Pacific the purchase price was nominal, and to the Union Pacific the stock was without much value. The company operated at a loss, and neither the Union Pacific management nor any of the financial analysts paid any attention to the stock as an asset. Gould was not guilty of such an oversight. Through a syndicate consisting of himself and other members of the board, he bought the road's holdings at $25 a share, assuredly a reasonable price for a deficit company. Next, he canceled the Western Union's contract with the Atlantic & Pacific. Then followed the execution of a contract with a newly organized cable company, the Direct United States Cable, which for the first time challenged the monopoly of the Anglo-American Telegraph.

Meanwhile Gould set out to increase the efficiency of the telegraph service of the Atlantic & Pacific. In his search for technical improvements, Gould encountered the then young inventor later to become so famous, Thomas A. Edison. In 1870 Edison had devised and patented a scheme for sending two or four messages simultaneously over one wire, the ownership of which he shared with a partner. Edison tried to sell his device to the Western Union, but though that company made an initial payment, it refused to go through with the agreement. Gould, learning of the patent, had one interview with Edison and for $30,000 bought his share in the famous quadruple. A few months later he assigned the patents to the Atlantic & Pacific.^36

Gould was now ready to strike at the business Goliath, and in February of 1875 he opened hostilities. His company reduced rates between Boston, Albany and Washington and intermediate stations to a uniform basis of twenty-five cents. The next day the Western Union met the cut. A few months later he struck another blow. Capitalizing on his close business relations with Scott, he succeeded in negotiating a contract with the Pennsylvania Railroad by which the latter agreed to permit the Atlantic & Pacific to erect new wires along its entire line and connections.^37

Then Gould suddenly stopped. He did not extend the war of rates. The Western Union however stood firm; it was not frightened. Gould again stood face to face with the aged Commodore Vanderbilt. The Commodore in 1869 had bought a substantial interest in Western Union,^38 and soon thereafter applied his policies of corporate management. Dividends were passed and earnings used to finance improvements. The standard of service was raised and rates reduced. In its corporate strategy the Western Union was Commodore Vanderbilt. Gould comprehended the situation quickly. He could make no impression with a rate war, and Vanderbilt made no move to buy him out. Clearly, that was Gould's intention, and he became anxious, if not solicitous, about his investment in the Atlantic & Pacific stock. He took the initiative in his plan to palm off the company on the Western Union. Talking through the vice president in charge of operations, he publicly disseminated statements on the large savings that a consolidation would create. Union of the two companies, it was asserted, would save $1,500,000 a year.^39

Gould then entered into negotiations with prominent shareholders of both companies. By the end of 1876 he had accumulated between 70,000 and 80,000 shares of Western Union stock, and reports spread that a consolidation with or sale to the Western Union was already made.

The nature of these negotiations has never been revealed. Vanderbilt was not disposed, after his experience with the Erie, to make life any easier for Gould or his clique, and he refused to budge. Early in September, after several weeks of negotiations, it was announced publicly that the consolidation of the two properties had been formally abandoned.^40 For the remainder of the year Gould, finding it difficult to frame a policy, did little. Then death came to the elder Vanderbilt in January of 1877, and Gould's mind was set. Recognizing that with Vanderbilt's death went also the backbone of the enemy's leadership, he resolved to resume the struggle on a broader, more aggressive basis. (Hereafter, except where otherwise mentioned, Vanderbilt refers to W. H. Vanderbilt.)

He found an ally in the Baltimore & Ohio, then engaged in a railroad rate war in eastern territory. The war involved an old principle. Baltimore and Philadelphia served, respectively, by the Baltimore & Ohio and the Pennsylvania railroads, insisted that their lines be permitted to carry freight to and from these cities at rates lower than those charged by the New York Central and the Erie on New York City business. This was necessary, so it was contended, in order to equalize the lower ocean rates and other services which tended to favor New York City as a shipping center. Gould, overlooking no opportunity, took advantage of this opening, and succeeded in diverting the competitive aggravations from the railroad to the telegraph field. He was able, in short, to utilize the antagonisms of the railroad rate war as a tool in his telegraph war. The Western Union was a Vanderbilt property.

A thrust at the Western Union was a thrust at Vanderbilt. Gould asked John W. Garrett, the fighting president of the Baltimore & Ohio, to serve on the board of the Atlantic & Pacific. The contract of the Baltimore & Ohio with the Western Union was not as ironclad as the typical arrangement, and there was good legal ground for believing that the contract could be canceled. Gould asked Garrett to do this very thing, thereby bringing the Baltimore & Ohio's line into the fold of Gould's telegraph company. He pointed out that the Western Union's stock was watered, and that, therefore, with the help of Garrett's property, competition would be facilitated.^41

In mid-February, 1877, a few weeks after the death of the elder Vanderbilt, the new policy of Gould's telegraph company was formally announced. The board of directors was enlarged, adding Garrett and Jewett, president and receiver of the Erie. Two of the four trunk lines were now represented on its board. The board was further strengthened by the election of Huntington, the dominant power in the affairs of the Central Pacific, and C. K. Garrison, who held the controlling interest in the Missouri Pacific. Another newcomer was James R. Keene, a speculative trading capitalist, just arrived in the East after making a series of successful trades in the gold and security markets in California. He had some loose cash, and Gould induced him to take a speculative flier in Atlantic & Pacific. Keene shortly thereafter brought Sage into the venture.

Shortly after the organization of the new board, the company announced its expansion program. To finance this new program the board authorized the sale of 200,000 shares of common stock at $20 a share. It also ordered a sweeping reduction in rates. The new rate structure produced losses for both companies,^42 as Gould had intended. In announcing the heavy rate cuts, he informed the public that he was working for the public welfare, thus following the same technique that he had pursued a few years before as president of the Erie. He had then been fighting the New York Central-Vanderbilt monopoly, and was now fighting the Western Union-Vanderbilt monopoly. The Atlantic & Pacific, said a Gould-sponsored statement of the board of directors, had "been the pioneer in extending the benefits of cheap telegraph communication to the public. Whenever they [Atlantic & Pacific] have been in competition with the Western Union, a reduction of rates has been the result."^43

Gould now massed his fortunes to attack the very heart of the power of the Western Union—the exclusive railroad contract. His first shot was the cancellation of the Baltimore & Ohio-Western Union contract, and in February the Baltimore & Ohio transferred its telegraph business from the Western Union to the Atlantic & Pacific. His next blows were delivered in Ohio and Indiana where the Atlantic & Pacific had executed contracts with a number of railroads which then had exclusive arrangements with the Western Union. The Atlantic & Pacific was stopped by injunctions and the exclusive contracts upheld.^44 He then turned to the Northwestern and the Rock Island to whose boards he had just been elected. On these roads he held minority interests, and although he promised much, he accomplished little. About the same time he entered into active negotiations with the Erie whose president was also on the board of the Atlantic & Pacific. Although at times success seemed close at hand, the Erie finally decided to retain its Western Union management. In short, the Western Union's exclusive railroad-telegraph contracts were almost universally sustained.^45 The Western Union, nevertheless, for the first half of 1877 to earn its dividends. The fortunes of the Atlantic & Pacific meanwhile, in the language of the president of the Western Union some years later, were "at low ebb."^46

Vanderbilt, son of the Commodore and his successor in business, obviously could have exploited these weaknesses for the benefit of the Western Union. Since his fortune was tied up largely with the earnings and value of the New York Central system, his interest in the Western Union was not his primary one. He owned most of the stock of the New York Central and a large block, not a majority, of the stock of the Lake Shore, whose earning power had not yet been well established. Shortly before the death of his father in January, 1877, the eastern rate war broke out anew. Its effects were particularly damaging on account of the deepening depression. The spring of 1877 was severely gloomy. Railroad earnings fell and stock prices dropped to new lows. The prolonged railroad rate war intensified the existing pessimism. Early in April, however, both the railroad and the financial worlds were surprised by the sudden ending of the rate war. The principle of rate equality between eastern ports which Commodore Vanderbilt had espoused and which was so glowingly endorsed by his son was surrendered in the new agreement of April 5. Vanderbilt "virtually [yielded] all that [Commodore Vanderbilt] won," observed a financial writer.^47

To Gould this settlement was a signal, representing a beacon on the right path to negotiations with Vanderbilt. William H., unlike his father, was not temperamentally constituted to fight a battle to its bitter and necessary conclusion. He had developed the conservative instinct of the investor and could not appreciate the importance of changing values and of changing economic forces. He would not turn away from approaching personal loss at the expense of a corporation and its bond and stockholders. On the other hand, he had the instinct of self-preservation. He usually waited for the attack, and if he was attacked, he defended himself. If the losses were too severe, he habitually compromised with or appeased the aggressor. Gould understood these habits of mind. Vanderbilt's surprising concession in the agreement to end the rate war in April, 1877, taught Gould how to play his cards in the approaching negotiations designed to unload the weakening Atlantic & Pacific upon the shoulders of the powerful Western Union.

In addition to the New York Central and the Lake Shore, Gould in dealing with Vanderbilt also had to take into consideration two additional sets of railroad properties. First was the north shore line from Chicago to Buffalo via Detroit. From Detroit to Buffalo two properties competed for the through business. One was the Great Western, in which Vanderbilt had no interest. The other was the Canada Southern, a line with exceptionally low grades and with low operating costs. It was built by a group of promoters with whom Drew was associated; but almost before the road was opened for through business, the panic of 1873 deprived it of financial support. At Detroit these two roads were fed with eastbound traffic by the Michigan Central, which for many years prior to 1873 was financially one of the strongest in the country. It was also essential for Vanderbilt to cultivate friendly traffic relations with a railroad from Chicago to Omaha in order to command a part of the eastbound transcontinental business of the Union Pacific.

Gould, aware of these relationships, used them skillfully in his negotiations over the Atlantic & Pacific. In April of 1877, within a few days after Vanderbilt negotiated the eastern railroad rate agreement, Gould, taking advantage of a sharp market break, bought enough shares of the Rock Island and the Northwestern—two of the three Omaha-Chicago roads—to get him on the boards of both.

No sooner had he found a place on these boards than the report spread that he had acquired control of the majority of the stock of the Michigan Central as well as of the Canada Southern. The sharp drop in the price of the former's stock lent color to the story. Many of the old stockholders sold,^48 though Moses Taylor, the veteran president of the National City Bank, held on. So did Samuel Sloan, the vigorous chief of the Lackawanna, and indeed in the early market break of the stock, he even added to his holdings.^49 In the spring of 1876 Taylor made up his mind to use his influence to elect Sloan as the successor of Joy to the presidency of the road. In June of 1876 the Taylor ticket, with Sloan at its head, was easily elected.

By the time the 1877 annual election approached, the affairs of the Michigan Central had not improved. An open proxy fight developed. One ticket was headed by Dillon, president of the Union Pacific, and an intimate Gould associate. Such a group might divert the Michigan Central business from the Canada Southern to the Great Western and, combined with a rate war, might succeed in impairing the value of the Vanderbilt holdings in the Canada Southern.

Even though the Gould ticket opposed the existing Sloan-Taylor management, there was no community of interest between it and the Vanderbilt ticket. Sloan himself was not averse to admitting Vanderbilt to the board; indeed he believed that such a representation would improve the competitive situation and facilitate the organization of a pool between the Michigan Central and the Lake Shore.^50

As the time for the annual election drew near, Sloan lost some of his earlier confidence. Although he and Joy were working hard to line up the proxies, the climax took place in the home of Taylor in New York City. The balloting was as close as Sloan had feared. Taylor, true to the type of conciliatory and peace-loving interests of the investment banker, insisted that harmony must prevail on the Michigan Central's board. He was anxious to be rid of speculators and therefore wanted no representative of the New York Central on the board. In view of the conservative Vanderbilt following this might appear strange, though it is not so strange when it is understood that Taylor believed Vanderbilt's proxies would include those of Sage, Dillon and Gould. Taylor had received information from certain stockbrokers that Vanderbilt had written Gould asking him about his proxies.^51

Gould, however, was playing a careful, complex game, and Vanderbilt, neither for the first nor for the last time, seemed entirely unaware of his real motives.

A few days before the election, Vanderbilt called upon Taylor at the latter's home. On the occasion of his first call, June 19, in a talk which lasted an hour and a half, Vanderbilt denied that he wished to acquire control. He wanted only some representation on the board of directors. In the discussion Vanderbilt at no time mentioned Gould's name; but while the discussion was proceeding, a messenger arrived with a telegram from Gould addressed to Taylor, in which Gould inquired whether Taylor was certain that without Gould's proxies he was sure of electing his ticket. The Gould messenger informed Taylor that Vanderbilt had telegraphed him that he had enough votes to control the election.

On the evening of the twenty-first Vanderbilt again called upon Taylor, and again Vanderbilt explained that he wanted only to be represented on the Michigan Central's board. He now recognized that the promised hope from Gould would not be realized. Vanderbilt himself had only 30,000 proxies, while Taylor had 80,000; and with Gould and Dillon, respectively, controlling 40,000 and 25,000, Vanderbilt concluded to throw his support to the Taylor ticket, thus insuring the defeat of the Gould combination. When Taylor informed Vanderbilt that he could not promise him representation on the board, Vanderbilt, with a dramatic gesture, declared to Taylor, "There are the proxies, you can use them."^52

Since both the Gould and the Vanderbilt proxies were turned over to Taylor, the Taylor-Sloan ticket was re-elected to office by a sweeping majority. In consequence of the proxy battle, Vanderbilt recognized that Gould held the deciding position in a contest for control. The Taylor following did not consist entirely of strongly held stocks, and an increase in the price of the stock would probably bring about selling from holders who had carried it all the way down, and, who on the way up, would be able to recover a portion of their cost. Some of the stock sold by disappointed investors might therefore be bought on the open market. Under these circumstances it was probable that the support of the Gould and Dillon proxies would probably exert the controlling influence in the annual election of the Michigan Central in the summer of 1878.

It is probable that in the summer of 1877 when negotiations were proceeding for the union of the two telegraph companies, such a possibility was presented to Vanderbilt. Gould, in trading on behalf of the Atlantic & Pacific, held the whip also over Sage who with his speculative associate, Keene, was a large holder of the Atlantic & Pacific stock. The stock was only 20 per cent paid up, and in view of the company's deficit, an assessment would soon be necessary—an outcome which was more than Sage had bargained for.

It is therefore probable that Gould presented Vanderbilt with a proposal somewhat as follows: I will sell to you, Mr. Vanderbilt, sufficient stock to enable you to acquire a controlling influence in the Michigan Central, and in turn you will purchase from me and my associates the controlling influence in the Atlantic & Pacific. It is also probable that Gould might have induced Dillon to agree to sell his large holdings of the stock of the Canada Southern to Vanderbilt.

In the Michigan Central's annual election of June, 1878, the control was passed to Vanderbilt. As late as April Vanderbilt kept repeating the denials he had made in the summer of 1877, that he was not buying control of the property and that if control did pass to him, it would be accomplished through proxies. The fact remains nevertheless that he had been buying stock steadily since July of 1877, and it is significant to observe that this was shortly before the execution of the agreement for the sale of the Atlantic & Pacific to the Western Union.

A final agreement in the form of a consolidation and pooling arrangement for the sale of the Atlantic & Pacific to the Western Union was made in August, 1877. Although the one was not necessarily contingent upon the other, the president of the Western Union was sufficiently realistic to understand that a pooling agreement, unless it was accompanied by control, would not be kept. The Western Union bought more than 72,000 shares at $25 per share, payable partly in cash and partly in its own shares; the president piously expressing the hope that the pooling agreement and stock control would stop "wasteful competition."^53 If the current report can be accepted that Sage, Keene and associates controlled 58,000 shares out of the 72,000 involved in the agreement, then they must have looked up to Gould with a sort of reverential awe. The Atlantic & Pacific was weak financially. With the optimistic expectations entertained so lavishly early in the year almost gone, and with the monthly statements indicating an inability to earn even operating expenses, Gould succeeded in unloading this property in exchange partly for cash and partly for the stock of one of the best investment properties on the Stock Exchange.

As a result of this transaction, Gould enlisted the services of two powerful associates. The Atlantic & Pacific was the first transaction in which Sage joined with Gould since the latter exposed the former in the Pacific Mail. Only two months before, Gould in entering the Rock Island board did not take Sage with him. After the telegraph agreement, Sage's membership with Gould on corporate boards was almost a universal rule. The salvage of the Atlantic & Pacific investment cemented a life-long friendship between the two men.

The immediate results of the agreement were satisfactory to all concerned. The short-period results of most of Gould's moves were usually satisfactory, thereby enabling him from time to time, as changing circumstances required, to obtain the support of leading personalities. He could drop them later as changing circumstances again dictated. When he needed a public propagandist, Fisk was at hand; when he needed strong leaders and market supporters, Keene and Sage were at hand; when he needed citizens of eminence and respectability, Cyrus W. Field and Joy were available.

While Sage and Keene benefited from the unloading of the semi-defunct Atlantic & Pacific onto the Western Union, the Western Union stockholders were not harmed. In fact the immediate effect was favorable. Western Union which late in July sold below 62, sold late in August, soon after the consolidation, more than 20 points higher. This consummation was of course gratifying to Vanderbilt and he was congratulated by both his friends and enemies. Perhaps he felt like Neville Chamberlain when he returned to England after concluding the Munich Pact in September, 1938. He had saved the peace for his own people and had given his enemies the opportunities they desired. The latter advantage, in either case, except for a few farseeing souls, was not appreciated. Vanderbilt set an unfortunate example twice in one year in appeasing his enemies. The Atlantic & Pacific contract was especially unfortunate. It put promoters on notice that if they could produce sufficient noise and disturbance and exert sufficient loss on another property, their own loss would be temporary, since they would eventually be taken over by the corporate Santa Claus. Vanderbilt did not learn this lesson immediately. Not until the summer of 1884 did he take firm ground, as his father always had done, in rejecting compromises with corporate racketeers.

It is probable that after his disposition of his Atlantic & Pacific stock, Gould's major holdings consisted of his large block of Union Pacific—more than 50 per cent of the total outstanding—and his increasingly large holdings in the junior securities of the Kansas Pacific. In the latter part of this Union Pacific period, from the fall of 1877 to the winter of 1878-79, Gould accomplished little. In these years, as indeed during most of his Union Pacific association (1874-84), his control was almost absolute. Charles Francis Adams, Jr., when president of the road in 1885, expressed the opinion, "that some years ago Mr. Gould was the Union Pacific Railway Company. His will was just as much law in it as the will of the captain of a frigate on board his ship. Mr. Dillon (president) was his representative. Mr. Dillon never consulted anyone except Mr. Gould, and Mr. Gould was in the custom of giving orders without consulting Mr. Dillon at all. These orders were implicitly obeyed."^54 In his efforts to exploit the possibilities arising out of his domination of the policies of the Union Pacific he was not successful. Neither did he succeed in building up the earnings of the Kansas Pacific. On the eastern end of the transcontinental line, his program must also be set down as a failure. He made no impression on the Omaha-Chicago roads; his moves to exercise an influence in the corporate policies of the Northwestern and the Rock Island produced only slight results. At the eastern terminus of the Kansas Pacific in Kansas City, his efforts were similarly unsuccessful. He also failed in his grab for the Hannibal.

By the fall of 1878, moreover, the value of Gould's Union Pacific holdings became questionable. The dividend due in July, 1878, was passed. This was due largely to a law which obliged the road to pay 25 per cent of its net earnings into a federal subsidy sinking fund. In October the road resumed dividends, but on a basis reduced from 2 per cent quarterly to 1½ per cent quarterly. Though for months the price of the stock ranged between 65 and 70, it was reported that bankers would lend money on the stock as collateral only at a marked-down price of 30; and at that price the paper profit of Gould's Union Pacific disappeared.

To some extent the lack of interest in Union Pacific stock was due to the concentrated ownership of more than a majority in the hands of one man: Gould. It was due also to the baneful influence of Gould's financial and speculative methods. The collapse of the Pacific Mail after his retirement in the spring of 1876, his lack of faith toward his railroad associates in the directorate of the Atlantic & Pacific, his chicanery in undermining the Hannibal, and his faithlessness in dealing with Villard in the negotiations for the reorganization of the Kansas Pacific gave him and his controlled Union Pacific a bad name. No intelligent trader would trade in a stock, a large part of which was controlled by a leading operator whose career marked him as one who would not hesitate to use any means to achieve trading results. And his methods induced the average investor to shun the purchase of a stock over which Gould exercised all but complete control.

Furthermore, the earnings of the Union Pacific were no longer rapidly expanding. In the fall of 1878 a government source informed the investing public what the railroad world already knew. The physical condition of the Union Pacific, reported the agency, was not satisfactory; its "deficiencies [were] many and apparent," and the management gave no evidence that it was "the work of any superior organizing mind."^55

Gould's financial position late in 1878 was made more serious by errors in trading judgment. Gould was optimistic on the grain roads, and when in the summer of 1878 reports of heavy crop damage broke the price of the granger (i.e., the Northwestern grain carriers) stocks, his losses were heavy. Gould shared the common gloom arising from the drop in stock prices, and in the fall of 1878, just as the market was about to move up under the influence of the approaching resumption of specie payments, he revised his trading position, and sold granger and other stocks short. A well-known railroad capitalist and a close observer of stock-market affairs declared that Gould at that time was a "very great bear" and that he was spending the greater portion of his time depreciating the value of the Northwestern and St. Paul securities.^56

Gould's trading judgment was wrong. The preparations for specie resumption were carefully made, and the damage to the grain crop proved to be exaggerated. A good crop combined with a short crop in Europe brought in a large supply of gold. The price of the dollar in terms of gold rose, and by the end of the year the dollar sold at par with gold. The stock market began the rise which did not end until the summer of 1881.

The upward market movement, furthermore, was well led and well organized. Keene, Gould's trading associate in the Atlantic & Pacific speculation, was the leader of the traders operating for the rise. Keene was favored by Gould's trouble with his trading associates. Late in 1878 his former trading allies became his enemies. Keene, understanding the weakness of Gould's trading armor, moved to break him financially. The path seemed easy. Gould's heavy holdings in Union Pacific and Kansas Pacific were pledged to secure loans—mostly due on demand. The Union Pacific market was not too good; the Kansas Pacific market was nominal. Keene invited Gould's creditors to a conference to settle with Gould, and all except Sage accepted. The demands for immediate settlement upset Gould and it was reported that he sold 40,000 shares of Union Pacific. Another meeting was called and according to one story, Keene at this meeting delivered an ultimatum: Gould must leave Wall Street forever—or be irretrievably ruined. Gould agreed but Sage saved the day. Learning of Keene's tactics, he went into a towering rage, declaring that Keene had gone too far, and that he would back Gould to the end. He did. The next morning Gould gave Keene a check for $2,000,000. The check bore the name of Sage, and Gould was saved.^57 Though the details of Gould's finances are not available, enough is known to assert that Gould was in real financial danger. Patrick Geddes, a private banker in New York and a large stockholder in a number of western railroads, wrote confidentially to a business associate that Gould's cash means were very much reduced, and that he was told that Gould was no longer feared or followed.^58 Another influential railroad stockholder, W. L. Scott, of Erie, Pennsylvania, reflected financial opinion when he observed in a letter to the president of the Northwestern that if any reliance could be placed upon what everyone says, Gould in the fall of 1878 had lost from a million and a half to three millions of dollars and that he was then in a tight position.^59

In the winter of 1878-79, therefore, Gould as a trader was in an unenviable position. He had a large block of Union Pacific stock, the price of which was stable only because he did not and could not sell any more of his holdings. His Kansas Pacific securities had slight value, and the threatened foreclosure of the Denver Extension mortgage promised to eliminate even that. On the other hand, the securities which he had sold short had advanced. Hence, his paper profits on his securities owned were elusive; while the losses on his securities sold short were real and heavy. His reputation among traders meanwhile reached a new low. "He is a man who can't make any money himself," said one trader, "and doesn't want to see anybody else do so."^60 And another, described in the press as one of the three greatest Wall Street operators, declared, "Nothing that Gould undertakes will ever amount to anything."^61

Out of this drab outlook in the winter of 1878 and 1879, Gould by brilliant maneuvering, and by shifting into new fields with speed and decisiveness, succeeded in the course of the next three years in reaching the pinnacle of business power and influence. In these years his moves were almost uniformly successful, and before the end of the period he became in many respects the leading railroad man of the land and undoubtedly one of its most powerful financial leaders.

## Notes for Chapter VIII

1. Huntington to Hopkins, April 19, 1875, MM.
2. This agreement is critically analyzed by one of the muckraking journals of the day, *The Road*, May 15, 1875, 118-19. The writer was presumably the editor, T. S. Fernon, who for many years was an able observer of the growth of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and who was familiar with the work of Scott. Referring to Gould and Scott as "that brace of local filibusters," he concluded that the transaction was primarily "a Gould-Scott job." See for summary of plan, *Chron.*, May 15, 1875, 476-7.
3. Known hereafter as the Rock Island.

George Tyson, an officer of the B. & M., in a letter to Perkins, May 21, 1877, repeats the same story. Harris in a letter to Perkins, May 16, 1877, credits Riddle of the Rock Island with the opinion that Gould and Dillon desire "very much" that the route via the Council Bluffs, the Hannibal and the Wabash shall participate largely in the business to and from the Union Pacific. These letters are found in Burlington archives.
