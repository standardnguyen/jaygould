## Chapter VII - Gould Acquires the Union Pacific

When Gould left the Erie in 1872 he was again a man of wealth. He had lost a fortune in the fall of 1869; he made another in the winter of 1871-72. He was now in funds, and could resume his activities in the business and speculative markets of the day. He was still in the brokerage business with Smith, and with him he engaged in transactions involving the locking up of currency with a view of affecting both the gold and the securities markets. Little is known about Gould's operations in these fields.[^1] He could not, however, long remain in action purely as a trader. In that role he was not at his best. He found it essential to operate in the securities of a given company, and by participating in its management to master the details of its business. With such knowledge, he could trade against the general run of traders.

His first spectacular success after the Erie epilogue, in trading in securities from the inside, with the aid of those familiar with the operations of the company, was in the Northwestern stock.[^2] It took only a few weeks to find another, and his choice fell unerringly on the leader in the speculative markets of the day—the Pacific Mail. Gould thus for the first time entered the transcontinental transportation industry. The Pacific Mail, long a prosperous company, had fallen from its high estate. Competition of the transcontinental railroad had wrecked its earning power and its stock had become a speculative football. Gould began to trade in this stock in the fall of 1872. The existing management, led by A. B. Stockwell, was tainted with fraud and dishonesty, and by early 1873 the company was in a critical financial condition.

The annual election took place in May and here Gould showed his hand. Though his name did not appear, his influence was clear. C. J. Osborne, a newly elected member of the board, was the senior partner in the brokerage firm of Osborne & Chapin, of which Gould was a partner. Another member was Sage, who like Gould combined the functions of stock-market trading and business activity. At this time Sage was already a veteran market operator, and in his career had realized heavy market profits and had suffered heavy losses. Sage, however, was more than a stock trader. He made heavy investments in corporations, accepted directorships and assumed managerial responsibilities. In many of his corporate connections he was active in financial machinations, and was frequently the center of dramatic struggles initiated by dissatisfied security holders. He possessed one advantage over many businessmen and market operators—he always managed to maintain an ample supply of cash; and this gave him an undeserved reputation for conservatism. A standard biographical source book, for example, describes him as "one of the shrewdest and most conservative of all great financiers."[^3] He was passably shrewd, but only his heavy losses in the panic of 1884 taught him conservatism. Indeed, he was one of the country's great risk-takers, and though constantly fishing in speculative waters, had the happy faculty of assuming his risks in a low-priced market.

This was the man with whom Gould allied himself. It was the votes cast by Gould that elected Sage to the Pacific Mail board.[^4] The other new board member was Trenor W. Park, with whom Gould had done some speculative business, and upon whom he thought he could rely to do his bidding. The new management was elected by minority holders, and the methods were partly the same as those used in the Erie election of 1868. It was a typical Gould board; outside of the president—and he did not last long—the members were traders and stockbrokers. After some curious transactions, Sage became president of the company. The new management was not successful, the finances of the company turned for the worse, the price of Pacific Mail stock dropped sharply, and Gould's holdings showed him a heavy loss.

It was at this time that Gould made his original commitments in Union Pacific stock. The Union Pacific had completed its transcontinental line four years before. Of the original group, Oakes Ames became financially involved and made a composition with his creditors, though after his death in 1873 his sons so skillfully conducted the estate that they succeeded in retrieving substantially all of the lost ground. Oliver Ames, however, continued to hold his shares. Three other members of the board also lost heavily. When these people retired from the road's management in January of 1871, the company was left with a floating debt of $5,000,000 maturing in three months, secured by collateral with a market value about one-third less than the loan, and $10,000,000 of income bonds maturing between 1872 and 1874. The stock sold down to 9, the income bonds to 32, and the land grant bonds to 53.

The break in market prices was due in part to the publicity given to the company's finances. This road, like most of the railroads of the time, was built from the proceeds of bond sales. Although bondholders provided funds for a road's construction, they were rarely afforded the opportunity of participating in its future profits. Strange as it may seem, the bondholders took almost all the risk, and except for their limited contractual return, they enjoyed none of the profits. The common stock controlling the voting power represented normally only a nominal cash investment. Paradoxically enough, the issue of many rather than fewer shares of stock was widely denounced as an evil. In some cases the promiscuous issue of shares was followed by bankruptcy, in others by success. In neither case did the number of shares manufactured by promoters and financiers have any effect on subsequent earnings. A road could have earned and paid as much on one share as it could, and did, on thousands and in later years on millions of shares.

This increase in the number of shares outstanding did, nevertheless, lead to curious results. The law had evolved a quaint idea that a stock had a value independent of the earnings, finances, and physical condition of a railroad. The stock had a par value presumed to represent the value of assets which the corporation had received in the form of cash, property or services. In fact, the company in return for its stock rarely received cash or property. The services received were valued in terms of pieces of paper called stocks, and the millions of dollars of par value stock—purely nominal value—were normally retained in one way or another, directly or indirectly, by the promoters of an enterprise. Even such an acute critic of financial excesses as Charles Francis Adams, Jr., remarked with the mellowed maturity of many years of experience, "I do not think the stock-watering system amounts to much one way or the other."[^5]

This system, which corresponded to the realities of the time, was denounced by the consuming and shipping public. Some of the promoters became wealthy and their success was attributed to overcapitalization: that is to say to the issue of an excessive number of shares. Just as serious was the charge that rates were in some inscrutable way based neither upon costs nor competition, but upon the desire, even upon the necessity, of earning a return on the par value of the shares. This belief was not supported by experience. Some of the roads, such as the Atlantic and the Erie which had issued many shares, were in almost continuous insolvency; while others, such as the Lake Shore, the Fort Wayne, and the New York Central which had also issued many shares, were prosperous.

Of these overcapitalized companies the public spotlight in the early seventies was concentrated upon the Union Pacific. Oakes Ames had used political pressure in the halls of Congress, and a Congressional investigation had followed. The crude attempts to influence legislation by distribution of stock created a storm of excitement. Investor confidence was impaired and the price of the Union Pacific stock dropped. The Union Pacific furthermore was not living up to informed expectation. The increased traffic that was generally expected to follow the completion of the transcontinental route had not materialized.

The financial difficulties of the road in 1871 gave capitalists, not formerly connected with the management, the opportunity to acquire control. Aside from local groups there were at this time three major financial interests. Gould, as president of the Erie, had made an unsuccessful bid to set up a fourth group. A New York party was built around the aged Cornelius Vanderbilt, who was now through his individual stockholdings in control of the New York Central-Lake Shore route from New York City to Chicago. A second, which had already made its mark in the business life of the country, was known loosely as the Boston group and included such men as James F. Joy, John M. Forbes, and the Ameses. They had financed many middle-western railroads, including the Michigan Central, the Hannibal and the Burlington. The third group hailing from Philadelphia was loosely described as the Pennsylvania Railroad party. The bid made by Gould early in 1869 to wrest control of the Pennsylvania's western allies had invigorated the expansionist elements in the Pennsylvania management, and as the year 1871 drew to close, the road completed a vast expansion program from Chicago and the Mississippi River to New York City. In the central transcontinental area Scott, its vice president, was also a member of the board of the Kansas Pacific which controlled the line from Kansas City to Denver. That road had also an important local traffic, and by 1870 had become a leading cattle-carrier. Although Scott did not control the Kansas Pacific, he did, as a director, represent an important Philadelphia stockholding interest. Only a link between the Kansas City and St. Louis was needed to give the Pennsylvania a line extending from Denver to New York City.

In 1871 the Pennsylvania group succeeded in taking control of the Union Pacific. Scott, together with George M. Pullman, and Andrew Carnegie, at that time a leading manufacturer of railroad supplies, became a member of the board. Scott's election as president was considered by some as a turning point in railroad history, one of the best-informed railroad journals of the day observing that in consequence of this step the Pennsylvania Railroad would "be likely to control all the transcontinental traffic for many years to come."[^6]

The Pennsylvania, however, soon relinquished its control. As the date for the annual election of the Union Pacific in March of 1872 drew near, a managerial struggle developed. It was probable that the Vanderbilt group had by this time begun to recognize the influence which its major competitor was attaining in transcontinental territory. With the Pennsylvania in control of the Union Pacific and the Kansas Pacific, it was probable that it could swing eastbound traffic away from Omaha and divert it to Kansas City. Such a diversion would decrease the competitive strength of the New York Central and increase that of the Pennsylvania. Less traffic would move from Omaha to Chicago for delivery to the New York Central's Lake Shore route, and more would move to Kansas City and from that point to St. Louis for delivery to the Pennsylvania. The Vanderbilt system, be it remembered, had no line to St. Louis.

At the annual meeting in March of 1872, therefore, the expected happened. The Pennsylvania's representatives were dropped from the Union Pacific board and those of the Vanderbilt group took their place, Clark, a son-in-law of Vanderbilt, assuming the presidency.

The Pennsylvania group meanwhile expanded in the Missouri valley and in the Southwest. By interlocking directorates and traffic agreements, a through route between St. Louis and Denver was established, thus creating a line between Denver and New York. Scott was also elected president of two roads—the Texas & Pacific and the Atlantic & Pacific—which were planning to build to the coast.

Thus the three major financial groups of the late sixties and early seventies participated in one or more of the transcontinental routes. Yet none of them realized their transcontinental ambitions. Where they failed, Gould succeeded. His capture of the transcontinental routes was one of the major events in American business history, and his acquisition of large stock interests at a slight cost was indeed a compelling tribute to his genius in the arena of corporate consolidation. After the depression swept the country in the wake of the panic Gould was able to retain and expand his holdings. The two most powerful financial interests, those allied with the Pennsylvania and with the Vanderbilt-New York Central groups, were obliged to scuttle their extra corporate cargo and to limit themselves to their primary commitments in the territory between the Mississippi and the Atlantic seaboard.

Gould's first commitments in the transcontinental railroad situation were made in the spring of 1873, and years later he described the circumstances in which he made his original commitments.

"In the spring of 1873," he testified before a Congressional committee, "I met Mr. Clark and Mr. Schell at Chicago. Mr. Clark was the president of the road and he and Mr. Schell (Augustus Schell, treasurer of the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern) had been out over it and were on their return trip. . . . And they spoke so highly of the property that it induced me to send an order down to New York to buy that stock. I was on a trip over the Chicago & Northwestern, and I sent an order down, I think, to begin at 35 and buy the stock; buy it on a scale down. Well, it seems that Mr. Clark was then ill. He returned, and when I was off up in the woods he grew worse, and his brokers discovered that he would have to die, and they took the opportunity to sell his stock, and my orders caught it. After I got home the stock kept going down, and I got alarmed about it and began to inquire into the condition of the property. ..."[^7]

Gould's tale probably was factually correct. This statement was not, however, strictly truthful. Gould knew of the poor financial condition of the Union Pacific, the floating debt, the notes held by directors and the early 1874 maturity of the income bonds. This was all public property. He did not disclose to the Commission that at that time he had an important stock interest in the Pacific Mail, that his representatives were on the board of the Pacific Mail watching his interests, and that shortly after his acquisition of the Union Pacific stock, Sage, a fellow broker who had been nominated to the Pacific Mail's board through the help of his votes, became president of that company. Gould, probably, already had conceived ideas of the suppression of the competition between the Pacific Mail and the Union Pacific. If rates could be harmonized in such a way that the competition of the water route was eliminated, it was clear to Gould that an influence on the board was essential. That in turn could only be attained by a substantial interest in the stock. He was aware of the financial position of the Union Pacific and of the risks he was assuming.

Neither was it correct to say that Clark's death depressed the price of the Union Pacific. A week after his death, the stock after moving down from 26⅛ to 24½, returned to 26⅝; but two weeks later it sold at 29. The price declined because of the general market trend, and the threat of legal action by the government. In the midst of his buying program, the attorney-general filed a bill against the Union Pacific, its construction company, and a large number of individuals, suggesting that the court, among other things, declare that the Land Grant bonds and the Income bonds had been unlawfully issued. The price of Union Pacific stock declined the day after from 30½ to 25¼.

Meanwhile Gould had become interested in a relatively small property in New Jersey, the New Jersey Southern. Between the New York metropolitan area and the Delaware and eastern Maryland peninsula there was a profitable traffic in fruit, vegetables, fish and oysters which was controlled almost entirely by another road. Although the New Jersey Southern alone reached no important sources of traffic, it could by construction and acquisition provide the basis for a new route to compete for this profitable business. At its northern terminus, in December of 1870, it had made a contract with the Narragansett Steamship Company, controlled and operated by Fisk, Gould's Erie associate, by which it had an entrance into New York harbor, while at its southern end, another small road gave the company a connection with the Delaware Bay. The purchase of ferries and the acquisition of small roads in Delaware and Maryland and some further construction would produce the competitive through route.

In October of 1872, Gould and a new board of directors was elected, Gould becoming president. The road had outstanding both first and second mortgage bonds. The interest on the first mortgage bonds both in 1871 and 1872 had been earned by "a considerable sum."[^8] Gould soon after his election issued an optimistic statement, so characteristic of his accession to power of a new property, promising "to make the road second to none of the great lines running to New York."[^9] The route that Gould established was a queer-looking affair, consisting of portages and ferries, three-fourths rail in two separated parts, and one-fourth waterway across three bays. Despite all these disadvantages, the Gould management made some efforts to negotiate a new Baltimore-New York through line.[^10]

To finance the formation of this route Gould in May, 1873, created a third mortgage with an authorized issue of $8,000,000 of bonds, of which $7,000,000 was reserved for the refunding of outstanding bonds. He then offered for sale the other $1,000,000 and also 10,000 shares of stock at par. The financial proposal was a failure and he succeeded in selling none of the bonds.

When the panic hit the country the road was in an unfinished state. It had a floating debt which could not be met; it had fixed charges that could be paid only from the movement of through business, and this could be secured only if arrangements with connections could be made. To perfect the through route and restore the finances of the company required a heavy investment. Gould, after the panic unable to supply the funds, promptly threw his commitment overboard. In October, 1873, at the end of his first year as president, he resigned, and arranged a default in the payment of interest on the road's first mortgage bonds. Before this final gesture, however, he provided himself with a strategic position in the road's financial structure. To secure a loan of $600,000, he acquired valuable collateral, especially the common stock of the Long Branch extension.

Gould was also confronted with losses arising from the Northwestern corner of December, 1872. In the settlement Smith and Drew paid him a large sum to discharge their outstanding short contracts. To make this corner effective, and to maintain a high price for the stock, he was obliged to buy a large number of shares. It is probable that the Clark-Schell group, knowing of Gould's anxiety to corner the stock, permitted most of the floating supply to pass into his hands. In any event, Gould was unable to sell all his Northwestern stock after the corner was completed. Though for months he tried to unload, he was not successful. More than four months later Gould, according to one observer, was still carrying most of the stock on his shoulders—after the manner of the mythological Atlas.[^11] In the panic he sold as much of the stock as he could "to anyone who would take it. The whole operation was a most disastrous speculation for him."[^12]

In disposing of his Northwestern and other stocks, thus lightening the burden of his financial obligations, he showed his superiority as a businessman and as a trader over most of his contemporaries. Neither Scott in his ramified operations in railroad and industrial lines, nor McHenry and his associates in their numerous adventures, nor Jay Cooke in his support of the Northern Pacific, displayed Gould's ability to dispose of part of a cargo in order to protect the rest. Scott's losses were particularly severe. The Pennsylvania Railroad, as the result of an elaborate examination by a stockholders' investigating committee, withdrew from the South and West, to confine its activities to the territory north of the Potomac and the Ohio and east of the Mississippi.

Gould, on the other hand, saved his Union Pacific commitment. Though his paper losses were heavy and he had some trouble in negotiating his loans, he managed to survive. Gould's personal secretary, and long his intimate associate in many of his operations, stated years later that the panic left Gould "comparatively a poor man. ... I doubt if any man parted with more cash and securities than did Mr. Gould by reason of the catastrophe."[^13]

Gould's main object in the months after the panic was to save the Union Pacific. The immediate and pressing problem was the floating debt maturing in August. If it could not be paid or funded into other securities, the road would go into receivership. Probably Gould would then follow in the path of Cooke to find a refuge in the courts, or he might lose his hope of securing a commanding influence in transcontinental railroad properties and thus follow in the footsteps of Scott. He did neither. In conjunction with other directors, he succeeded in transforming the floating debt into a longer-term bond issue.[^14]

Gould then undertook to handle the income bonds maturing in 1874. The retirement of this obligation had long been considered by the Union Pacific management, and under Clark's leadership plans had been laid for its refunding. The management was embarrassed, not only by the short maturity but also by the high interest rate of 10 per cent. These plans called for a 7 per cent gold bond to take care of both the income bond and the floating debt.[^15] Clark was not successful, and neither at first was Gould. Vexatious legal proceedings were begun to block the new plans, and investor opinion began to reflect the impending inability to meet the $10,000,000 maturity. The future looked gloomy.

Congress had passed a law in March of 1873 withholding the payments due the Union Pacific by the government on account of government freight, as part payment for interest on United States government bonds lent to the road to help finance its construction. Long negotiations failed to bring about a satisfactory result, and in July of 1874 the Union Pacific began suit to recover the amount retained by the government.[^16]

In the first half of 1874 these depressing influences reflected themselves in the stock market. The price of Union Pacific dropped, and Gould bought more stock. In the spring his election to the board occasioned little notice. The new president was Sidney Dillon, who now for the first time became associated with Gould. Dillon was primarily a railroad contractor and builder, of the firm of Dillon, Clyde & Company. At that time he was described as a man who had constructed probably as many railroads as any other living man.[^17] He did not, as did Drew, Smith and others, cross Gould's path in strictly financial matters. To such men Gould exercised an exceptional loyalty and from them he also drew a corresponding measure of personal loyalty and support.

In the midst of the depression, however, things began to assume a more favorable aspect. The sharp contraction in production and consumer demand which had prostrated most of the country had not as yet reached the Far West. The silver business was good and gave the Union Pacific a heavy volume of traffic at attractive rates. In 1873, moreover, the California cereal grain crop proved to be large, far in excess of the crop for the preceding year. The Union Pacific could say, therefore, as it did in the summer of 1874, that while other roads were showing a loss in traffic, the Union Pacific showed "no falling off whatever."[^18] Also, because of the absence of competition, local rates were exceptionally high.

Gould meanwhile had resumed his trading activities. After having failed to gauge the major turn in the security markets in the fall of 1873, he reappraised the minor trends successfully. In the new environment he traded well, adapting his trading program to the new financial and business background. He took his losses promptly, reduced his liabilities, and confined his investment holdings to a few securities—primarily the Union Pacific and the Pacific Mail. In the secondary rally in the security markets late in December of 1873 and early in January of 1874, he took a heavy short position, and by the late summer of the year, he and his trading associates were given credit in some circles for having realized $5,000,000 in trading operations.[^19]

During the same period Gould and his associates were working on a plan for the exchange of the income bonds for new sinking fund bonds. By the middle of September the exchange was accepted by a large percentage of the bondholders. This news, despite the existing reaction in the stock market, boosted the price of Union Pacific stock. "The principal feature of the stock market was Union Pacific, . . ."[^20] declared a watchful Philadelphia analyst in September. This phrase was significant in its description of the existing market and was a prelude to many a stirring Gould market in the years to come.

In the fall of 1874, however, Gould was not yet ready to lead the market with Union Pacific, since a number of problems required solution before the stock could be utilized for market purposes. First was the competition with the Kansas Pacific. The road was still controlled by the group of Philadelphia capitalists, led by Scott, now president of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Although the Pennsylvania group no longer exercised a commanding influence in western railroads, Gould thought it wise to conciliate Scott. With this group as friends, he could look forward to securing some part of the westbound business of the Pennsylvania for the Union Pacific. He, therefore, welcomed harmonious relations between the Union Pacific and the Kansas Pacific, and after lengthy negotiations succeeded in perfecting a temporary agreement for dividing the business of the two roads.[^21]

Both shared now in the transcontinental traffic and both took immediate advantage of the elimination of competition by raising their rates. This was the first of a number of steps Gould took to stabilize competition between the two lines. Every step, including this, the first one, seemed to have every reason for success. The stock-market effects were consistently favorable, and the competitive position of the roads always seemingly improving. Yet the business realities were so deep-seated that in each case the remedy, short of final and complete consolidation, did not succeed.

Gould had succeeded in elevating rates on traffic moving between interior points, on traffic, that is to say, exempt from water competition. The rates on business subject to water competition, however, were still depressed by the fight with the Pacific Mail. In order to improve the earnings and outlook of the Union Pacific it was essential to minimize, and if possible, to eliminate this competition. Although Gould was not on the Pacific Mail board, his brokers, Smith and Osborne, were. The Pacific Mail by early 1874 had recovered some of its credit standing.

Gould early in 1874 began negotiations with the company for a contract to minimize competition. Preliminary soundings failed. A senate committee meanwhile recommended that the subsidy to the Pacific Mail be eliminated, and the price of its stock slumped.

This was followed by events which throw a lurid light upon the affairs of corporations whose executive officials are primarily stockbrokers or bankers. The annual meeting of the Pacific Mail was held late in May. Early in the month, both Sage, president, and Rufus Hatch (also in the brokerage business), vice president and managing director, issued optimistic statements. Sage declared flatly that the Pacific Mail was "destined to become the great steamship company of the United States."[^22] Under the impetus of these optimistic observations, Pacific Mail rose from 37 to 45.

At the annual meeting held in the last week of the month the management was re-elected. The Gould representatives on the board were charged with working in his interests. Gould had been trading heavily in Pacific Mail, and he had sold out since Sage had informed him of the "worthlessness"[^23] of the stock. Just when this conversation took place is not known, but from this time on, it seems probable that both Gould and Sage, president of the company, were on the short side of the market.

Meanwhile a rate war between the Pacific Mail and the transcontinental railroads sharply reduced rates between New York City and San Francisco. Furthermore, the Pacific Mail succeeded "in diverting nearly all the China trade via the Isthmus"[^24] (of Panama). The earnings of both the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific were reduced. Huntington, the dynamic personality behind the latter road, had supported a new line of English steamships established early in the summer. Though the failure of the venture left the Pacific Mail in a strategic position, Gould took steps to exert pressure on its management. The depression had left many idle ships in British harbors. Gould bought a number of them at the prevailing low prices and organized a new enterprise, with the board of directors consisting of members of the Union Pacific board and of other American and English capitalists. Though Huntington refused to support this new venture, Gould persisted. Taking advantage of the harmonious relations existing with Scott, he asked him to arrange a steamship service between Philadelphia and Liverpool to serve as the Atlantic division of his new West Coast shipping enterprise. It may be questioned whether Gould ever entertained the idea that the project would be a successful competitor of the Pacific Mail. The competitive threat, however, was part of his technique. If he could not succeed in negotiating directly, he threatened competition and then immediately backed up his threats by appropriate action. Sage, as president of the Pacific Mail, made light of this new venture, describing it as "ridiculous."[^25]

Nothing came of it. Huntington refused to endorse it, and Sage refused to be frightened. Huntington continued to press his negotiations with the Pacific Mail for a new contract. He was primarily interested in diverting transcontinental traffic from the water to the rail route. If this could be accomplished, the Central Pacific would raise rates on through traffic destined for points far beyond the eastern end of its line.

While these negotiations were progressing, the rumor spread that a member of the board of the Pacific Mail was selling its stock short. A special meeting was held and it was resolved that it was "highly unbecoming" for any director "to persistently sell the stock of the Company short."[^26] Sage denied that he was guilty of this practice. There is little reason to doubt, particularly in view of the events of the next few weeks, that Gould and his brokerage associates were responsible for the rumor.

Huntington, however, was not interested in these stock market machinations. Having been rejected by the Pacific Mail, he made up his mind to organize a competitive project. He revived Gould's plan and jointly with Gould organized a new company—the Occidental & Orient Steamship Company. It was capitalized at $10,000,000, but the original stockholders put up only $300,000 in cash. The company used chartered vessels; it owned none of its own. The enterprise proved highly profitable.

The organization of the competitive steamship line exerted the necessary pressure on the Pacific Mail. Before the end of the year an agreement was finally reached with the railroads guaranteeing the company a monthly rental.

This contract created a working arrangement between the water and rail routes, and removed the fear of rate wars. To Gould such an alignment was not satisfactory. A contract, he recognized, could be canceled with or without reason. He decided to get control of the Pacific Mail. However, the time was not yet ripe. The stock was reasonably but not cheaply priced. To buy at existing prices a controlling interest, say 100,000 shares out of a total of 200,000 outstanding, would have cost about $4,000,000. The board meanwhile was not satisfied with the denials of Sage concerning the short selling of its stock, and another special meeting was held late in November. Sage took the aggressive. There were members of the board, he said (referring probably to the Gould representatives), who were selling the Pacific Mail stock. (Informally, after the board meeting he stated that he had referred to the Gould representatives, Osborne and Smith.) The latter retaliated; the retaliation, revealing the hand of Gould, declared that Sage, knowing of the Pacific Mail's floating debt, had sold all of his Pacific Mail, and had sold additional shares for short account. Sage denied the accusation, and Osborne then delivered the telling blow. He read a letter from Gould which insisted that Sage had a short account at Osborne's office. A dramatic scene ensued. Sage insisted that the accusation was false. The board however was not convinced. At an informal meeting held later with Sage absent, it was resolved that if Sage did not resign he would be removed. A few days later Sage resigned.

Sage's retirement from the presidency and the public revelation that the directors were selling the stock short, further depressed the price of the stock. Gould in the press of the day was advertised as a bear on the stock. He also had company from the president and perhaps other members of the board. Under these conditions there was no reason to suspect that a buying movement in Pacific Mail would develop. So, if Gould wanted to buy the Pacific Mail, the way was open. Following the break in December Gould and his associates saw their opportunity and bought into Pacific Mail at prices almost as low as those reached in the panic. Gould thus was able to acquire a strategically valuable property at a low price.

In the meantime Gould had increased his Union Pacific holdings. Early in 1875 he owned 100,000 shares, Dillon owned another 26,000 shares (out of 367,000 outstanding). The fortunes of the road were improving, both gross and net in the first two months exceeding that of the corresponding period of 1874. The property's capacity for carrying business was substantially beyond the volume of business done, and with no "considerable" additional expense and with no increase in its outstanding debts, the company could double its volume of business.[^27]

Gould was careful to make these favorable facts available to the public. The monthly earnings were published immediately. Late in February the president took occasion in a statement to the bondholders on the successful exchange of the sinking fund bonds for the old maturing-income bonds, to express optimism. Stressing the growing importance of the local traffic and the retention by the Union Pacific of the mineral and coal-bearing lands, he went into details to describe the increase in ore and bullion traffic, which, from rather ambiguous figures, indicated a 100 per cent increase in 1874 over 1873. He also explained that coal could be mined on the company's land at low prices. Furthermore, because of the absence of the "violent competition" existing in the East, the traffic yielded a good profit. These facts, concluded the president, "warrant the steady rise in market value" of the company's bonds.[^28]

The way was thus prepared early in March of 1875 for a market movement. On the third of March it was announced that Gould and his associates had been added to the board of the Pacific Mail. The rate war between rail and ship was over, and rates were sharply increased.[^29] The market responded to the new transportation environment. The Union Pacific, in control of the Pacific Mail, was now free to increase its rates without fear of competition from the steamship route. With the volume at high levels and moving at monopolistic rates, the earnings picture of the Union Pacific was bright. On the morning of March 4, the day after the assumption of Gould control of the Pacific Mail, excitement on the New York Stock Exchange was "intense." Nearly everybody, according to one observer, began to trade in Pacific Mail and in Union Pacific. Soon after the opening of the Exchange, "there followed such a scene of frantic excitement, as has seldom been witnessed on the Stock Exchange." The trading in these two stocks was in "immense" volume. The same observer asserted that the "Pacific Mail will be lifted from the slough of despond . . . and again assume its proper attitude." At least, he continued, with a commendable hedge, this was the promise.[^30]

The financial future of both the Union Pacific and the Pacific Mail were to be revolutionized. Shortly after the buoyant market of early March in these two stocks developed, the annual report of the Union Pacific made its appearance. Gould, speaking through this document, informed the stockholders that the importance of the road's increasing mineral traffic could hardly be overestimated. He again described the increasing production of the silver and gold mines. The establishment of friendly relations with the Pacific Mail was stressed as "a very important matter," enabling the Union Pacific to charge "remunerative" rates for freight and passengers.

The support of the Union Pacific, furthermore, would be helpful to the Pacific Mail. Though the latter's current liabilities were probably in excess of the current assets, Gould upon taking control early in March, expressed the utmost optimism: "I will see the company through financially," he remarked to one of the Pacific Mail officials.[^31] The association of the company with the Union Pacific deeply impressed financial observers. It was recognized that the company was "likely to become the mere tender of the Union Pacific . . ." but under the auspices of the latter company, and with some freight guaranteed for its steamers and with some reduction in expenses, it was "better even thus to lose its significance than to be the football of brokers and speculators."[^32]

The sponsorship of the Union Pacific soon brought about results. By a new arrangement between the steamship company organized under the joint Gould-Huntington leadership, and the transcontinental railroads, the two steamship lines alternated on the United States-Oriental service. The ships would run in conjunction with the overland railroads and the Pacific Mail. The railroads would divide earnings on through business between China and the United States. Gould would benefit both from his Union Pacific and his Pacific Mail.

By the end of April the hopeful predictions, combined with the favorable contracts (some of which on close analysis seemed flatly to contradict each other) produced a rise in prices. The Union Pacific moved from a trifle more than 40 to almost 80, and the Pacific Mail from the lower 30s to slightly more than 43. On July 1, the Union Pacific declared its first dividend of 1½ per cent quarterly which was increased to 2 per cent on October 1.

The Union Pacific, both in volume and in price appreciation, overshadowed the market. The stocks of Union Pacific and of the Pacific Mail combined frequently accounted for more than 50 per cent of the transactions in all stocks on the Stock Exchange.Here's the continuation of the formatted chapter:
