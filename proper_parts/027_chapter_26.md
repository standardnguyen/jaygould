## Chapter XXVI - Gould Expands in Kansas and Colorado

The Missouri Pacific in 1884 was confined largely to the state of Missouri. In addition, through stock holdings and lease contracts it controlled an extensive system in Arkansas, Texas, and Oklahoma. It had also preferential arrangements with the Texas & Pacific (commanding outlets to New Orleans and El Paso), and with the Wabash (extending the system to Chicago, Toledo and Detroit). The road had extended little after its first burst of growth in 1880 and 1881. Although it thereafter acquired a number of branch lines and built some feeders in the coal fields of southern Missouri and Kansas, its mileage early in 1885 was not substantially higher than four years before.

The territorial stability of the Missouri Pacific was part of the general equilibrium in the Missouri Valley. The roads east of the Missouri had not built lines west, and the roads west of the river had not built lines east. In southern Kansas, the Atchison served a territory free from competition. It had a written understanding with the Frisco, its partner in the construction of the Pacific Coast extension, whereby each road agreed not to build any lines in southern Kansas without permission of the other. The Atchison also had agreed not to expand east of the Missouri, and the Missouri Pacific not to expand in southern Kansas.

The Burlington's Denver extension was the first major factor which undermined this equilibrium. The war of rates that followed the Burlington's invasion of eastern Colorado was followed by the Tri-Partite compact and the dissolution of the Iowa Pool. The competitive forces unleashed by the Burlington extension and the dissolution of the Iowa Pool were too powerful to be settled by compromise and concession. The consummation of the Tri-Partite in the waning days of 1883 stimulated Perkins's plans to add hundreds of miles in Union Pacific territory in northern Nebraska and eastern Wyoming.[^1] Owing largely to the conciliatory approaches of Forbes, however, these construction programs were not immediately carried out. Forbes placed great faith in his ability to work out by personal conversations with F. L. Ames and Adams some arrangements which would block the moves that threatened to break the earning power of the participating companies. The rate truce he arranged failed. Adams felt strongly, even bitterly, about the Burlington's plans to extend its lines into Union Pacific territory. The Burlington, he thought, was planning to take advantage of the Union Pacific's weak financial position to drive it into insolvency. Perkins now learned for the first time that Adams, who was soon to become president of the Union Pacific, was considering the advisability of selling the Central Branch (since 1880 leased to the Missouri Pacific) and the St. Joseph & Western (successor to the Denver City) to the Missouri Pacific and to the Rock Island respectively. To the Burlington, such a program involved serious dangers. Two of the most aggressive roads in the Missouri Valley area would thus be introduced into the trans-Missouri region. Perkins, with remarkable power of penetration, peered through the facades Gould had set up to conceal his interests in Union Pacific policy. The Central Branch occupied a rich region in Kansas. He suspected that Clark, the operating manager of the Union Pacific, was playing into the hands of Gould with no regard for the real interests of that road.

Forbes, however, continued his policy of caution. He suggested that in the tight condition of the money market it was unlikely that any large construction program would be undertaken by the Burlington, the Union Pacific, or by any Gould road. He would be slow, he continued, to spend any money in occupying new ground in anticipation of a competitive battle, and, he concluded, it would be better to save money now, conserve financial strength, and carefully to avoid any measures that might involve any large new expenditures.[^2]

The expansion forces were, however, only momentarily checked. A road, by getting more business from new territories, could carry more traffic at a slight increase in cost. Railroad managements thought, as did theoretical economists, in terms of static relationships. They assumed that while one factor changed, all the other factors would remain the same. They reasoned that while a particular road expanded and invaded new territory, the other roads would stand idly by. Or perhaps if they did not stand by, all the roads, having each other's territory, would again be able to reach an understanding and thereby arrest any downward movement of rates.

Another factor which modified the fundamentals underlying these territorial understandings was the sudden increase in population in western Kansas. The trunk lines had built their mileage largely in the eastern half of the state. West of the 100th meridian the state was considered a desert country, incapable of producing crops or supporting a large population. Some settlers had gone into this area shortly after 1870. Their failures had been disastrous. In 1884 and 1885, however, the situation changed for the better. Rainfall in the arid zone increased and stories spread that the climate had permanently changed. This widespread opinion was reflected in a rush of people to the arid plans of western Kansas and Nebraska and eastern Colorado. In two years, more than $30,000,000 was invested and a real-estate boom was on.[^3] The desert area which had experienced so many disasters suddenly attracted many people and much money. The most significant phenomenon, however, was the rush of railroad capital into this hitherto unproductive area.

The investment of heavy capital in response to a temporary influence should not surprise the trained observer. Few indeed are the businessmen and political and military leaders, for that matter, who look ahead many years in an effort to align current trends with long-term influences. Those financial opportunities which are likely to bring results in one or two years are normally preferred to others which bring larger results in twenty years. The immediate effects normally impress businessmen and investors. It was, for example, the guarantees afforded to the railroads' earning power by the Transportation Act of 1920 which led to the investment of billions of dollars by institutional investors in the following decade, and it was the unbounded confidence in the future of the utility holding companies which led to the spectacular rise from 1925 to 1929. Investment and financial growth come in spurts and they are the result largely of short-term influences.

As the depression influences waned in the closing months of 1884, and as the tempo of returning prosperity was quickened in the early months of 1885, the deep-seated desire to maintain rate and territorial stability clashed head-on with the aggressive forces motivating railroad expansion. In the spring of 1884 the Burlington and the Union Pacific had agreed to build no roads without notifying each other,[^4] and in the following summer Cable of the Rock Island, in justifying the organization of the Tri-Partite, declared that there were "already more roads than were needed both east and west of the Missouri River, and to build additional roads meant ruin to all existing lines."[^5]

Forbes expressed himself in a tone of savage denunciation: "The tribe of Hinckleys, Cranes, Graves, Villards, and other cranks and thieves led by Hopkins and Gould, have built and will build Roads wherever fools with money will follow, and where three Roads stimulated by contracts, are thus built to do the work of one, it, in the very near future, leads right up to a necessity for the nearest solvent Railroad to buy the other useless ones...."[^6]

Against these judgments making for caution in railroad expansion policies was the policy of the determined managements of the Burlington, Northwestern, St. Paul and the Rock Island, and of course the aggressive personality of Gould. Early in 1885, the St. Paul and the Rock Island were preparing to strike for a greater share in the Colorado, Utah and the Pacific Coast traffic. Under the Tri-Partite these roads could cut on westbound traffic and the Union Pacific was obliged to participate. Adams had repeatedly expressed his determination to achieve peace in western territory, but under the Tri-Partite he was helpless in the hands of his eastern allies.

While these forces were in their developmental stage, Perkins thought that he saw an opportunity to stabilize the situation anew, without at the same time seriously endangering the interests of the Burlington. He was convinced that Adams did not know what he wanted. What the Union Pacific, as well as the Burlington and the Northwestern (the other two eastern roads with lines west of the Missouri River) needed was a peaceful arrangement among themselves, with the Rock Island and the St. Paul being held at bay on the eastern side of the river. If this situation could be maintained for another five-year period, the western lines could so thoroughly occupy the country that the temptation to build by any other road would be slight indeed.[^7]

A detailed plan for co-operation between the Burlington, Union Pacific, and Northwestern designed to promote these objectives was presented by Perkins in a letter to Adams in March of 1885. Perkins proposed, as a basis for bargaining, that the Union Pacific agree to give the Burlington, and perhaps also the Northwestern, all the business not covered by the Tri-Partite, and that it alone or with the Northern Pacific, lease the Oregon Railway & Navigation Company. The major roads would then agree to divide the territory. Unless such an arrangement were made, Perkins declared, there would be a trial of strength; the Burlington would expand north into Nebraska and beyond, and the Northwestern and the Union Pacific would inevitably follow. The Union Pacific, according to the Perkins proposal, would also put two Burlington men on its board of directors and eliminate the Gould element.[^8] Though the plan was not approved, Perkins continued to negotiate. In May he succeeded in completing an arrangement between the roads west of Chicago, designed to stabilize rates for a six months' period. It now appeared as though the rates "were in a fair way to be reasonably maintained west of Chicago for some time to come."[^9]

The agreement was not final until approved by the Burlington's board of directors, and this approval was never secured. For, before it could be carried into effect, Gould had acted and in his customary way broke the pillars of the agreement. The Missouri Pacific system was not interested in these problems. From its St. Louis and Kansas City anchors, the road extended southwest and not west into Kansas and Colorado. Gould did not choose to assume a passive attitude. This was a policy alien to his temperament. In compliance with the letter of the agreement, he did not invade the Atchison's territory in southern Kansas. He was not prepared, however, to go along with the spirit of the understanding, and to remain passive and refuse to share in the rich traffic of southern Kansas, crossed and recrossed by his major Kansas competitor. He therefore turned aggressive, though indirectly and unobtrusively. The Missouri Pacific, with which the Atchison had made the agreement, performed no act of aggression. The aggressive move was made by Gould personally. Viewing the southern Kansas railroad field in the early eighties, he observed the growth of a small road—the St. Louis, Fort Scott & Wichita,[^10] organized to build a line between Fort Scott and Wichita. The line was opened for business in July of 1881. In 1882 Gould acquired a majority of its stock at $10 a share.

It was not clear whether the Atchison was aware of Gould's interest. If it was, it did nothing to counteract it. Perhaps the Atchison was not aware of Gould's ability to interpret financial and industrial agreements to his own advantage. In any event, the Atchison at first pursued a passive policy, but when the Wichita in the spring of 1883 began to build west into its territory, it grew restive. The company's management became convinced that the Missouri Pacific was financing the Wichita's extension, and, according to a Boston observer, a quarrel appeared to be imminent.[^11] Meanwhile the road continued to expand. It was not until the summer of 1884 that Hopkins, an official of a number of Gould's railroads, was appointed president of the property, thus making it clear for the first time (certainly to the outside public) that the road was under the Missouri Pacific influence.

While Gould was thus expanding through the media of the Wichita in southern Kansas, he was also moving along different lines in northern Kansas and southern Nebraska. In this section, the Missouri Pacific in 1885, aside from its extension from Atchison to Omaha, controlled only a nominal mileage. However, it operated, though it did not own, the Central Branch. The road was poorly maintained; most of the track in 1884, for example, was still laid with its original iron rail, and, in the opinion of the Kansas commission, was so battered that both life and property were "in constant jeopardy in transit over them."[^12] Gould persisted in his efforts to buy the road, and Adams was not entirely unfriendly to the proposal. Perkins feared that Gould's acquisition would be followed by its extension to Denver. He finally negotiated an understanding with Adams, not reduced to writing, and never submitted to the respective boards, by which Adams agreed not to sell the road nor to take other territorial action without previous notice and consultation.

By the spring of 1885, therefore, Perkins believed that he had succeeded in stabilizing competition in Kansas and Nebraska. Late in May, however, he learned that a new railroad company organized in Kansas to build a line to Denver, with Gould's name attached to it, had just been announced in the public press. He was certain that Gould by taking this step "intended to bulldoze the Union Pacific into making such arrangements about the Central Branch as might be agreeable to the Missouri Pacific."[^13]

Meanwhile the rate structure began to soften. The St. Paul withdrew from one of the traffic pools and slashed rates on dressed beef from Omaha. "It [seemed] as though the St. Paul road," wrote a Burlington official, "was bound to wreck itself and everybody else if it [could]."[^14] Trouble continued to accumulate, and within a few weeks after the St. Paul's action, the Atchison announced its withdrawal from the transcontinental pool.

The rate wars were followed by breakdowns in territorial stability. Plans which had long been maturing were now put into execution. The Burlington had long considered the idea of building an extension to the Twin Cities. Ever since the St. Paul in the early eighties had completed its line to Omaha, "making practically a new line all the way from Chicago," the Burlington considered the wisdom of allowing "so powerful a competitor" to secure a foothold in the Burlington's country without the latter retaliating by going north.[^15] In 1885, adopting the same tactics that had been followed in Nebraska, the road arranged for the building of a St. Paul line through a corporate affiliate—the Chicago, Burlington & Northern. The Burlington executed a contract for the interchange of traffic with this newly organized concern and agreed to purchase its bonds with the understanding that they soon would be exchanged for the stock at par. It also acquired a large block of the stock of its affiliate.[^16]

This was an invasion of the territory of the Rock Island and the St. Paul, the two allies of the Union Pacific in the inglorious Tri-Partite pact. The Burlington's invasion was described by a leading Chicago railroad journal as "the most important recent event in the western railway field."[^17]

Both the St. Paul and the Rock Island reacted promptly. A few months thereafter the directors of the former met secretly in New York City, and, according to a leading eastern railroad journal, decided to begin work on the extension from central Iowa to Kansas City.[^18] This retaliatory move was likely to hurt the Gould system, since the line would penetrate local territory served by the Missouri Pacific and the Wabash.

The Rock Island, like the St. Paul, was not prepared to permit invasion of its territory by the Burlington without retaliation. Its management, stirred even more than that of the St. Paul, became actuated by an "indefinite desire to extend itself in all directions."[^19]

The opening gun in the battle for territorial expansion in the West had now been fired. The Burlington had invaded the territory of the St. Paul and the Rock Island, and the latter two had invaded the territory of the Burlington. The battle in the Missouri River Valley had not yet spread to wider areas. It was still possible to limit the warfare to the three major contestants. There was no compelling reason why the Union Pacific and the Burlington should not remain at peace in the broad territorial stretches of Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming.

This reasoning, however, did not reckon with Gould. It is not clear what pressure Gould exerted upon Adams to force a violation of his personal understanding with Perkins, with reference to the Central Branch. Adams had repeatedly declared that the breakdown in rates in territory common to both the Burlington and the Union Pacific was due to the Burlington. His Central Branch policy might also have been occasioned by the Gould pressure which Perkins had so frequently described as "bulldozing." Gould might have threatened to parallel the Central Branch with a Denver extension in competition with the Union Pacific. There is considerable support for the latter idea in the fact that Adams had considered the building of a proposed extension of the Central Branch to a connection with the Kansas Pacific.[^20] A few months before Adams had sent out surveyors to work up the prospective right of way, the story spread that a new Colorado company was planning to build east from Denver to a connection with the Gould-controlled Wichita in southeastern Kansas. Perkins believed this story was true, although he qualified his judgment with the reservation that perhaps Gould was going into the venture in order to force Adams to sell the Central Branch to Gould.[^21]

By early fall of 1885 Gould had bought up a number of small lines in eastern Kansas, and with the aid of some local construction he was ready to proceed with the building of a new line to Denver. The new company, the Kansas Western, capitalized at $10,000,000, announced plans to build through the Central Branch country. Adams presumably found his position uncomfortable. He had sent out surveyors to make plans and to submit reports. Gould, however, needed no such help. He was not interested in reports which to him represented a waste of time, since he and his associates had often examined this territory. Before Adams was ready to execute his plans, Gould had acquired feeders, had partially built some new lines and had let out contracts for the construction of others. By these actions he was invading Union Pacific territory. Adams hastened to ward off the invasion. In September, 1885, the Central Branch lease of 1880 was modified. Gould agreed not to build into Union Pacific territory nor to construct roads in Kansas or Nebraska competitive with the Central Branch. The latter, together with the Union Pacific, agreed not to build lines competitive with the Missouri Pacific. Both Gould and Adams thus relinquished the idea of building a new Denver route.

The Missouri Pacific, freed from Union Pacific rivalry, was now at liberty to expand in northern Kansas and southern Nebraska in competition with the Burlington. The Union Pacific, freed from Missouri Pacific competition, could more effectively fight its territorial battle with the Burlington in Nebraska.

Forbes, however, was not convinced of impending danger to the Burlington. He believed that Adams had been overhasty in striking hands with Gould, thereby giving him a legal contract "upon so flimsy a guarantee as Gould's promise that 'the said line will not build competing lines.' Gould [had] as many aliases as a London professional thief and in fifteen minutes [would] find a substitute to do his bidding if he [saw] his interest in it."[^22] Perkins, on the other hand, was disturbed. He proposed to Adams that the Burlington and the Union Pacific jointly build several lines and thereby minimize the cost of construction. "We deprecate premature construction and all talk of war," he wrote.[^23] Peace had, however, become impossible. It had become difficult for a major road to remain conservative, to refuse to build into new territory and to insist that the wisest policy was to refrain from incurring new burdens. While Gould by the modified Central Branch lease had thus paved the way for the opening of a potential Union Pacific-Burlington war, he was also preparing the ground for another competitive battle in southern Kansas. This struggle involved the Atchison. The territorial understanding with the Missouri Pacific had been beneficial to both properties. Much of the Atchison's earnings came from its hold on the business of southern Kansas. That region produced a large and profitable long-haul wheat traffic. Through its lines in that area, the Atchison profited also from the cattle traffic of Oklahoma.

Gould in acquiring and laying plans for expansion of the Wichita was invading the heart of the Atchison citadel. He had pushed the building program of the Wichita until the road reached a point in southern Kansas close to the major gateway for the valuable Oklahoma cattle traffic of the Atchison. The Atchison had made no move against the new competition, although by 1885 it was clear that the road was a Gould project. The Atchison was losing business, not only to the Wichita, but also to a number of new local lines in southeastern Kansas. If the Atchison retaliated, a war of rates was inevitable, and in such an eventuality the Atchison would have to absorb the entire cost. Much of its traffic moved east beyond the Missouri River. The Atchison had no through line into that territory, nor did it have any traffic alliances with roads which would absorb part of a rate reduction. The Wichita, under Gould control, had an outlet beyond the Missouri River in the Missouri Pacific, and beyond the Mississippi in the Wabash. That line was ready to cut rates and arrange through routes and divisions so as to benefit the Missouri Pacific.

It was vital for the Atchison, in order to meet this potential competition, to have an eastern line of its own. Aside from the acquisition of the Gulf, it had expanded little in the eighties. It was now destined to seize the offensive and to push into new territory. The road's management had discovered that in business, as well as in international politics, the doctrine of defense by aggression, although strictly illogical, is nevertheless eminently practical, and that in the face of an almost unanimous desire for peace, war becomes inevitable. The fight of Gould against the Burlington and the Atchison was thus partly responsible for the most promiscuous paralleling and duplication of railroad mileage in the country's history.[^24]

The surveys of the Atchison in 1884 for a Chicago line led to no action. The Gould aggression in extending the Wichita through southern Kansas, however, helped the Atchison to recognize the necessity for action. The company, declared its president, had been "much too conservative during the last few years."[^25] The management furthermore was convinced that the traffic agreements by which it served Chicago and the Middle West were unsatisfactory. Gould, among others, had demonstrated that a traffic agreement was practicable only if both parties had equal powers to enforce it. It was the history of such contracts, observed the Atchison wistfully in its 1886 annual report, that they were effective only so long as it was to the interest of the parties concerned to make them so, and broken as soon as they became burdensome to either party. It discovered, as did the democratic countries, one by one, from 1939 to the fall of 1941, that a policy of nonaggression invited attack from an aggressor. To defend its territory the Atchison concluded that it would be necessary to invade the territory of its opponents. "It would seem to be a fact," declared the management of this property in justification of its new policy, "that we had tempted these invasions by our own inertness rather than challenged them by an aggressive disposition."[^26]

The decision to expand was reached at about the same time by the Atchison and by almost all the major lines east of the Missouri River. Each road suddenly realized that a policy of aggressive invasion was the only safe defense. The president of the Rock Island, who in the summer of 1884 had decried the building of competitive mileage, was now leading his property in a program which carried it to eastern Colorado and to southern Kansas. The Burlington, deflected by Gould's sharp trading from expansion in Kansas in the heart of the Missouri Pacific country, launched a program of construction north of the Platte River in the center of the Union Pacific territory. The St. Paul hesitated long in initiating a trans-Missouri expansion; and as late as the summer of 1887 board was still considering the idea. It decided finally to depend upon traffic agreements for the interchange of business with roads which competed in its own territory. This was a historical decision. For the next quarter of a century its policy remained unchanged. It finally built in a period and under conditions which forced the road into a receivership at the height of the boom of the 1920s.

Through the Wichita, Gould had at small cost secured access to the traffic of southern and eastern Kansas. To the south of that line, the promoters of a local line, the Denver, Memphis & Atlantic, had been successful in securing subsidies from counties, cities and townships.[^27] The management was confident of the future, and during the next year planned to build in Kansas about 1,000 miles of road. In his plans to parallel the Atchison and to extend the Missouri Pacific to Denver, Gould did not overlook the possibilities of this enterprise. In the fall of 1885, in the very heyday of its corporate expansion, he announced plans to parallel this road, just as he was then laying plans to do the same to the Union Pacific.[^28] It is impossible to learn when he acquired control, or what pressure he placed upon the promoters to dispose of their interests. Although the first public statement of the control of this property by Gould was not made until October, 1886, there is little reason to doubt that Gould followed the same policy which he had with respect to the acquisition of the Wichita—he acquired a substantial interest but said nothing.

Following his Wabash tactics of 1879 and 1880, Gould endeavored to buy control of existing stub lines and feeders. By acquiring these roads, he was able, he thought, to ward off threatened competition which might result from their acquisition by other roads. On the other hand, some of the lines had light traffic density and thereby became a burden on the system. Gould understood this risk, but his mind was fixed more largely on corporate strategy. The justification of this policy was presented in a circular sent to the shareholders of the Missouri Pacific. The local lines were necessary, he said, "to protect the present traffic" of the company, and "insure its future growth."[^29] Some of these roads, remarked a close observer, seemed to have little value, "except as a basis for future extensions."[^30] It was the Wabash all over again.

In some of the Kansas acquisitions, however, Gould was more fortunate than he was with the Wabash. The Wichita, for example, turned out to be, in the language of the counsel of its promoters, "a perfect gold mine."[^31] After Gould acquired the majority of the stock, he recognized its financial possibilities and adopted policies to insure that profits of the road remain with the Missouri Pacific.

Aside from the corporate formalities, Gould's program of branch-line acquisition was completed by the end of 1885. So were the agreements and understandings which removed the Union Pacific and the Burlington as potential competitors. By that time the grand program of railroad construction of 1886 and 1887 had begun. It was the greatest period of railroad construction in the history of the country. No new through routes were opened. Between each producing and consuming area major trunk lines had already been laid out. Though there was general recognition that competitive construction would result in financial losses, the lines were built. The forces of competition proved to be superior to all considerations of reason.

Building was confined almost entirely to western territory. For the most part, except for the Atchison's Chicago line, the program was concentrated in the area west of the Missouri River and east of the Huntington lines in California. The geographical center, as well as the origin of the expansion program, was in Kansas. It was in that state that Gould's silent aggression through a number of ostensibly independent corporations set the stage for the giant expansion of competing lines. It was in Kansas that the Atchison, finally recognizing the weakness of a defensive policy, lashed out in a battle against Gould.

As the year 1886 opened, there was "a prospect for increased business, and consequently for increased revenue, never exceeded in the history of the company" (i.e., the Missouri Pacific).[^32] This language, which was applied by Gould to the destiny of his own railroad enterprise, could with equal truth be applied to the other western railroad properties. The crops were good; in Kansas they were exceptionally good. On the basis of short-term reasoning the prospects were excellent. It was therefore easy to sell bonds and stocks. Apparently all factors combined to make the next two years the banner period in the history of American railroad building. But they also served to lay the basis for financial disaster to railway investors.

Both of the major Kansas contestants, the Atchison and the Missouri Pacific, laid plans on an extravagant scale. The Atchison, late in 1885, proposed to build 2,400 miles in Kansas alone.[^33] The Missouri Pacific projected the construction of approximately 2,000 miles, and proposed to use its recent acquisitions as a base for a new line to eastern Colorado. There it made a contract with the Denver road which let it into the Colorado mountain country and made it a competitor of the Atchison. In order to accommodate the prospective increase in traffic which would rise from this new affiliation, the Denver agreed to build a third rail on its narrow-gauge road west from Pueblo. By the time the Missouri Pacific's extension was completed the third rail had also been finished. The Missouri Pacific now had a through line from the Missouri Valley to an independent connection with the Huntington system at Ogden. The Atchison, in turn, recognizing the implications of the new development, abandoned its trackage agreement with the Denver, and built a parallel line from Pueblo to Denver.

The Missouri Pacific, meanwhile, actively prosecuted its construction program. By the summer and early fall of 1886, Gould was personally supervising the building of over 1,000 miles of the Missouri Pacific. "My chief business at present," he said in September, "is to attend to the affairs of the Missouri Pacific." The cost, he continued, would be low, approximately only $12,000 a mile. The track would be laid with the best grade of steel, and oak ties would be used.[^34]

The Atchison also proceeded actively with its plans. By April it had already let contracts for the building of 345 miles in Kansas, with another 811 miles to be built before the end of the year.[^35] In October the company announced an increase in the number of branch lines to be built in Kansas from eighteen to fifty-two; an increase in common stock of its Kansas subsidiary from $48,000,000 to $154,000,000, and in the length of the road contemplated in that state, from 2,400 to 7,274 miles.[^36]

The extravagant plans of the Atchison and the Missouri Pacific were supplemented by equally ambitious proposals of the Rock Island. The president of the latter in the fall of 1886 had publicly proclaimed the unwisdom of duplicate railroad construction. He could not, however, sacrifice his road and the interests of his stockholders to a general principle. It was essential, he insisted, that the road command a sufficient volume of traffic from the productive areas of the West. The road was also influenced by the necessity of getting a supply of coal. The management therefore decided in 1886 to extend its lines from the tip of northeastern Kansas, through the state and beyond into Pueblo where it would reach the center "of the best coal district in the west..[^37] and also an active lead and zinc-smelting center, which then provided about 22 per cent of the traffic of the state of Colorado.[^38] Within the next three years the Rock Island, by this expansion policy, increased its mileage from 1,400 to 3,000 miles.

In part, these building programs in Kansas were stimulated by local public authorities. Kansas was one of the last states in the Union which continued to vote subsidies, both in cash and bonds, for the purpose of aiding railroad construction. The voting of public aid in 1886, when these construction programs were proceeding so rapidly, was "quite startling."[^39] The race for subsidies, especially between the Missouri Pacific and the Rock Island, was unique in western railroad history. There was open bidding, both in the state legislatures and in local legislative bodies. Little is known about the detailed lobbying and negotiations between the public authorities and the railroad managers. Some of the branch lines were poorly built, some were unnecessary, and some were built along lines which were different from those contemplated in the agreement with counties or townships.[^40] The subsidies reduced the cost of construction, and served in part to explain the speed with which the railroads pushed through the construction of such a large mileage in such a short time. Nearly all the lines built in 1887 by the Atchison, for example, were aided by the counties through which they passed, and so great was the help in some cases that the subsidies paid for the cost of construction.[^41]

Subsidies also helped to induce investors to finance the program. It was the first time in many a year that the railroad investors were presented with proposals to advance money in partnership with governmental bodies. Because of these subsidies the cost of construction would be reduced. Indeed, on a statistical basis, Gould could demonstrate when the construction program was completed, that under his administration the bonds and stocks outstanding per mile on the Missouri Pacific had been greatly reduced.

These programs of the Missouri Pacific and other roads were, in many respects, the most remarkable in American railroad history. Adams, president of the Union Pacific, observed that corporations had "contracted the madness, and [had] built hundreds of miles of road almost paralleling each other."[^42] The programs attracted the attention of railroad interests throughout the country. Roads were built over tenantless prairies, in advance of population and of transportation-supporting industries. They were built by companies which had decided to engage in a wild race to pre-empt territory. There was no thought of securing an immediate return upon the investment. It was a war of defense by aggression. In the strict economic sense of the word, the building of these duplicate lines might be called speculative ventures, and yet they were financed by orthodox financial methods. While much of the mileage built through more settled regions, both in the Middle West and in the industrial East, were financed by speculative construction companies and by the sale of bonds at substantial discounts, these ventures penetrating an inhospitable country supported by little traffic—the very center of the plain areas in which numerous disastrous crop failures had frequently occurred—were financed mostly by sales of stock and bonds at high prices.

When the program was completed before the end of the eighties, the state of Kansas had only a few points at which the farmer could not find a station within from twelve to fifteen miles of his home to market his produce.[^43] Kansas then contained a greater railroad mileage than New York, with a population of almost six million, to say nothing of its large manufacturing industries, and its location as the country's chief commercial center. It had more mileage than the state of Pennsylvania with the population of five and a quarter million to say nothing of its great steel, coal, and miscellaneous manufacturing industries, and a state which furnished more than fifty times the passenger and freight business of Kansas. Kansas, furthermore, had 1,050 miles more mileage than all the New England states combined, with their aggregation of more than five million people, to say nothing of their numerous transportation manufacturing industries.[^44]

The program had been inaugurated in a period of prosperity. In accordance with expectations, the westward flow of population and the extensive railroad construction increased the earnings of the Kansas lines in 1886. In the following two years, however, western Kansas returned to an arid condition. The rains failed; crops were exceptionally poor; the livestock was starved, and what little was left was rushed to the market. Crops in other sections of the country, however, were good. Prices of wheat and corn and livestock dropped, and produced a heavy depression in agricultural values. The stimulus given to railroad traffic by the good crops of previous years, and the traffic stimulated by railroad construction was lost by the fall of 1887. Gould in the summer of the following year stopped building on the Missouri Pacific.[^45] Other roads had already halted. The drop in business accompanied, if not primarily caused, by the depression in agriculture, superimposed upon the increase in parallel lines throughout the West, was followed by a break in rates without precedent in western railroad history. The western territorial equilibrium which served as a basis for railroad prosperity collapsed. A decline in traffic, combined with a demoralized rate structure, led to a wholesale passing or cutting of dividends in the late eighties, and paved the way for receivership and reorganization in the early and middle nineties. Before these results of the partially Gould-stimulated expansion program can be considered, it is necessary to analyze the Gould construction program in the southwestern part of his railroad system, in the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas.

[^24]: There is a curious effort, in a secondary source, made by an uncritical hero-worshiper, to fix the responsibility for the territorial war upon the Atchison. In an effort to dramatize the situation, a synthetic interview is presented between Gould, on behalf of the Missouri Pacific, and Strong on behalf of the Atchison. The Gould line is alleged to have kept its pledge not to invade the territory of the Atchison; and Gould, to avoid duplicate construction, is alleged to have suggested that he would take half of the lines already built by the Atchison through its newly formed subsidiary, the Southern Kansas Railway. This interview and offer is found in The Story of the Railroad, by Cy Warman, 121. There is no basis for this presumed interview. The evidence is convincing that Gould was the aggressor.
