## Chapter VI - Gould Leaves the Erie

In May, 1869, Gould was at the peak of his control of the Erie. He had disenfranchised the holders of almost all of the foreign stock, more than half of which was held by residents of England. They had bought the stock and secured title through a blank power of attorney, but Gould by various pretexts had made it impossible for them to cast their ballots. Furthermore, the Classification Act had just been enacted and this assured Gould's group a term of office for at least five years. It was at just about this time that a group of English shareholders, spurred on by the drop in the price of Erie stock, decided to secure a voice in the management of the company equal to their shareholdings.[^1] They organized a London protective committee, and arranged to transfer their stocks on the Erie's books in the names of two English citizens, Robert Amadeus Heath and Lewis Raphael. A power of attorney made out in their names was attached to the stock certificates and sent to a New York City banker.

Months passed before the committee was well organized and before the mechanism to effect the desired transfer of the stock was well established. Meanwhile Gould proceeded with the elaborate speculations that culminated in the gold panic of September, 1869. Before the English shareholders could make a move to assert their influence over the affairs of the Erie, a new opponent of Gould, Ramsey, the belligerent president of the Albany & Susquehanna, made an unexpected assault upon the Gould clique. The Gould group had made a determined effort to acquire control of his road. Before the struggle was decided, Ramsey suddenly took the offensive, bought some securities of the Erie, and in November entered suit with the view of ousting the Erie board. Ramsey was one of the rare opponents of Gould who familiarized himself with Gould's operations. He engaged counsel, a former Erie attorney, who in the opinion of Judge Barnard had a valuable knowledge of Erie's history,[^2] and with his help drew up a bill of complaint. Realizing he could accomplish little through Judge Barnard, he selected an independent judge, Judge Murray in Delaware County, before whom he submitted his charges. Judge Murray promptly issued the requested orders, suspended Gould, Fisk, Lane and others from the Erie board, forbade their doing any business for the Erie, and stopped all operations of Gould in selling stocks or interfering with the books and business of the Erie. He also appointed a referee to take testimony and establish the facts in the case.[^3]

Gould was not prepared for this move, having taken no counter-measures to ward off the blow, played for time. Although Judge Murray had issued the order, Gould was determined that it would not be served. For three days court officials pursued him. He was ejected from the Erie's offices. At home he concealed himself. On one occasion the court official caught him as he was entering his carriage, but before he could serve the paper he was seized from behind by Gould's escort, who was aptly compared to the private armies retained by medieval knights.[^4]

Judge Murray became indignant over this judicial farce, and on December 10 called a hearing to ascertain why the suspension order should not be made permanent and why the summons, complaint, order of suspension and the injunctions should not be served on Gould and his associates by leaving them at their respective residences. In the existing state of Gould's affairs, execution of this order would have been serious. His losses suffered in the gold panic had not been retrieved. With the help of his judicial associate, Judge Barnard, Gould evaded the trap set by Ramsey. Through some legal legerdemain he succeeded in securing an order from Judge Barnard enjoining Ramsey from proceeding with his suit. Furthermore Gould, as he had so often done before and was destined to do many times in the future, took the offensive. He induced Barnard to dismiss Ramsey's complaint and to hold Ramsey in contempt for bringing a suit a few weeks later in defiance of an earlier order of the judge. The Ramsey litigation lasted fourteen months and during this period Ramsey was free from injunctions only five days.[^5]

Meanwhile the Heath and Raphael group had begun action to force the Erie to transfer their stock. Their request was refused and litigation followed. The American counsel for the English group then decided to make an attempt to induce the assembly to repeal the Directors' Classification Act. He had preconceived opinions of the integrity of American legislative bodies, but was soon disillusioned. Later he wrote to his clients that he had been told by a member of the assembly that if he "had let it be understood that [he] had brought $20,000 to smooth the way, [he] should have made more progress.[^6]

It was clear to the Heath and Raphael group that nothing could be accomplished in the state legislature. The initial attempt to get the names of the English stockholders on the Erie's books through the orderly normal process of transfer had been rejected. The next move, made in the spring of 1870, produced a notable display of legal and financial pyrotechnics. To make their stock marketable under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, it was necessary to register the stock. As protection against duplication of security issues, the rules required that the shares be certified on their face that they were registered in accordance with its regulations. Unregistered shares were accordingly unmarketable. The shares owned by the Heath and Raphael group were part of the stock registered by the Erie with its registration agent, the Farmer's Loan & Trust Company. In order to identify them as genuine a block of 60,000 shares was deposited with the Erie. From this point the fireworks really began. No sooner were the certificates left in the Erie's offices than Gould and Fisk sped away to the offices of Judge Barnard. On a flimsy pretext the judge was induced to take the stock away from the jurisdiction of its English shareholders and appoint a receiver. The receiver delivered the shares to Gould, and Gould gave the receiver a new certificate.

Here was another opportunity. Gould at this time (the winter of 1870 and 1871) though still in debt was trading in securities. His old brokerage firm had been dissolved and had been replaced by the new firm of Willard, Martin & Balch. Though it is not clear what Gould's speculative position was at this time, it is certain that he needed funds and that the deposit of the English stock offered him the means of financing his needs. Of the 60,000 shares obtained by Gould from the receiver, 30,000 were so mutilated as to make it impossible to register them with the trust company.

Without the consent of the board or of the executive committee, Gould as president issued $3,000,000 of convertible bonds, converted the bonds almost immediately into stock, delivered the stock to the trust company for registration, and then sold the stock at current market prices. Though Gould never paid the Erie for any of the stock, the brokerage house did. How much it paid is not known.

To what extent Gould benefited from this raid cannot be ascertained, but the loss to the English shareholders is certain. They rushed back to the courts and asked Judge Blatchford to discharge the receiver. This was a reasonable request and the judge directed dissolution of the receivership and restoration of the Erie stock to its legitimate owners. The Erie raised no objection to the order—a puzzling reaction for Gould, who never surrendered without a struggle. The puzzle, however, was soon solved. Judge Blatchford's order of dissolution was to take effect on March 11, 1871. Two weeks before that time Gould had asked the ever ready Judge Barnard to appoint a new receiver for the stock. Judge Blatchford's order could not be executed because the receiver against whom it was issued had no stock. The stock was now in the hands of a new receiver who held some subordinate position on the Erie.

Judicial proceedings were protracted. Orders were issued against Gould to deliver the stock to the rightful owners and to reimburse them for losses incurred, but on one pretext or another Gould postponed final action until December of 1871. By that time, having completed the Cleveland & Pittsburgh and the Union & Titusville stock transactions, he was in funds, and in accordance with the order of the court he delivered the 60,000 shares to their legitimate owners. Since the Heath and Raphael group were about to get the right to vote their stock, they were in sight of victory, and furthermore, since an independent attorney-general and a new state assembly had been elected, they were also reasonably certain of securing the repeal of the Directors' Classification Act.[^7]

When the English stockholders were thus on the eve of success, another move was begun to oust Gould from control of the Erie. The new group was led by McHenry, the promoter of the Atlantic. The road's property by this time had been taken out of the receiver's hands. The reorganization, at least in London financial circles, had been hailed with relief. A journal, long an authority on British railway news, expressed the belief that investors would soon learn for the first time of the earning power "of this fine property."[^8] McHenry was quoted as stating that after allowing for a 60 per cent operating ratio there would be a large and increasing margin for dividends.

Plans were laid to make the road independent of the Erie. Narrow-gauge connections were to be made with the Pennsylvania for a line to Philadelphia, and with the New York Central for a line to Buffalo. A short extension from the controlled Cleveland & Mahoning would bring the road into the Baltimore & Ohio network and open a route between Cleveland, Baltimore and Washington.[^9]

The reorganized Atlantic moved fast in expanding its local traffic. McHenry was determined to exploit the possibilities of the oil business, and to free the road from its exclusive dependence on the Erie for outlets to the oil-consuming markets. Accordingly, he laid plans for the extension of system lines in the oil region of northwestern Pennsylvania.

As president of the road, McHenry chose General G. B. McClellan, a man of national reputation and distinction. Associated with McClellan in the road's reorganization in 1871 were Senator Thurman, and a banker, W. B. Duncan, of Duncan, Sherman & Co., a banking firm with good London connections. It was to this bank that J. S. Morgan had sent his son, J. Pierpont, to get his banking experience. McHenry organized a directorate of exceptional strength including Hewitt, the iron manufacturer, Lloyd Aspinwall, a capitalist held in high regard in financial circles, and J. H. Devereux, an able railroad man of Cleveland. The company's past financial troubles were conveniently laid upon the shoulders of the Erie. No longer, declared McHenry, would its earnings fall into the Erie treasury "whence they have not hitherto been readily extracted, . . ."[^10] Great hopes were entertained for the company's future earnings, provided it could be relieved of the dishonesty and inefficiency of the Erie management. An analyst in an elaborate article in an English railroad journal concluded that if the road were worked in conjunction with the Erie, but with the same honesty and regard for the interests of the stockholders as other trunk lines, it could earn a "handsome dividend."[^11]

In view of this optimism it is not surprising that the road's capital structure was not seriously disturbed. The company was reorganized in a period of national prosperity when traffic was expanding and railroad mileage increasing. The reorganization increased the company's capital account from $59,000,000 to $93,000,000, its debts alone equaling almost $140,000 per mile.[^12] The road was further handicapped because it ran against the prevailing direction of traffic. With the exception of Cleveland, it had no termini at any major traffic producing centers. To make matters worse, the new property was organized at the time when a business genius, John D. Rockefeller, was making plans to control the oil business and to dominate the oil traffic. Despite the unfriendly feelings between the Atlantic and the Erie, the latter was the major eastern railroad outlet for the former's oil business. The growing oil-refining industry of Cleveland secured most of its crude oil from the region served by the Atlantic. The latter therefore had a large east- and west-bound oil business, carrying crude oil west and refined oil east. By the fall of 1871, however, its position had changed for the worse. The Lake Shore by a short extension had succeeded in securing access to the oil regions, and since it could now send oil over its own system lines to Cleveland and to New York, it need no longer depend upon the Atlantic. Rockefeller, furthermore, had acquired Cleveland refineries formerly owned by men who were directors of the Lake Shore, and because of these acquisitions, Henry B. Payne and Amasa Stone were now stockholders of the Standard Oil and of the Lake Shore. Such a business arrangement meant more traffic for the Lake Shore and less for the Atlantic. The Lake Shore-New York Central system, instead of being a friendly connection of the Atlantic, became an unfriendly competitor.

About the same time, the Pennsylvania, moving to increase its competitive strength in the oil business, secured access to Cleveland and the profitable Rockefeller oil traffic over the Cleveland & Pittsburgh.[^13] In a few months after reorganization, the Atlantic was thus faced with powerful competition on its most profitable business.

Since McHenry was determined to fight for a larger share of the oil business, a rate war was inevitable. Though rates were low at the time, the new war reduced them further, and by 1874 a railroad commentator declared that the Atlantic did its business "at an astonishingly low cost," and accepted business at "an extremely low price."[^14]

Despite his insistence on the necessity for independence of Erie associations, McHenry discovered in a few months that there was no alternative, and that friendship with the Erie was inevitable. He therefore made up his mind to acquire an influence over the affairs of the Erie, but to do this it would be necessary first to oust the Gould clique. His opening gun was fired in a circular dated December 12, 1871, and addressed to the Erie shareholders. He had already rescued the Atlantic, he declared, and he now proposed to rescue the Erie by removing the present Erie directors. To achieve this purpose it was necessary that he buy Erie stock and get some proxies. In order to get financial help, he allied himself with an English financial house, Bischoffscheim & Goldschmidt, specializing in railroad securities.

Except for the common aim, the ousting of the Gould party, there was little sympathy between the McHenry and the Heath and Raphael groups. The amount of Erie stock held by McHenry was slight, while the holdings controlled by Heath and Raphael were substantial. The latter looked askance at McHenry, believing that he was interested chiefly in the Atlantic. Upon request of the Heath and Raphael group, Attorney-General Barlow had agreed to begin proceedings in the state courts against the Erie board. The McHenry group, making a more seductive approach, induced General D. E. Sickles, American Ambassador to Spain, to take an interest in its "public-spirited" activity to oust the nefarious Gould. Sickles asked Barlow to represent McHenry and his London banker in the United States, and Barlow accepted.

Early in 1872, repeal of the Classification Act was considered certain. In December of 1871, furthermore, the federal court finally convinced Gould of the necessity for permitting the transfer of a large block of Erie stock to its lawful English holders, almost all of whom were associated with the London Protective Committee, as the Heath and Raphael group was now called.

At about this time, when it appeared reasonably certain that Gould could be removed by the use of legal methods, the affairs of the Erie took a new turn. A member of the Erie's original executive committee trio, Lane, conceived the idea that in order to enhance the credit of the Erie, it would be wise for the Gould-controlled directory to resign. So convinced was he of the wisdom of this proposal, that a bribe was also considered acceptable. Whether Lane or some other party suggested the idea to McHenry cannot be satisfactorily determined. In any event McHenry was offered the Erie board for $1,500,000, and after some negotiation, the amount was reduced to $300,000.[^15] Had it not been for the well-known fact that McHenry was so anxious to acquire control of the Erie to help the Atlantic, it is probable that the proposal to buy the resignations of the board would not have been considered.

The Erie by this time was physically and financially an empty shell. It was borrowing from day to day and on the very morning of the day on which the Gould group left the Erie board, its floating debt was $3,930,000. The debt had been negotiated with bankers and others who were personal friends of Gould's and who had no interest in the affairs of the company. A new non-Gould management would therefore be requested to pay this floating debt immediately. Erie's treasury assets of stocks and bonds were pledged as collateral for loans.[^16]

In the face of this dreadful financial condition, with the credit of the Erie about to collapse, with receivership impending, with a heavy floating debt payable on call in the hands of creditors who had no reason to support the Erie, the board, in the early hours of the day of March 11, 1872, finally resigned. Barlow sent McHenry a wire, "Complete victory. . . . Gould removed. I congratulate you."[^17]

In this startling removal, the stockholders were not consulted. The Heath and Raphael group were dissatisfied. Had they known the truth, had they known of some of the conditions under which the Gould group resigned and the McHenry group took charge, they would have been even more dissatisfied, perhaps to the point of declining to co-operate. The Atlantic claimed that the Erie owed it between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000.[^18] What is even more significant, the money which had been used to induce the Erie board to resign was to be reimbursed to the McHenry group from the Erie treasury. In October, 1872, when the McHenry board was in control of the Erie, McHenry's London banking house collected $400,000 for "special" expenses paid on account of the resignation of the Erie board.[^19]

Neither did the Heath and Raphael group know that the Gould surrender was conditioned upon an understanding between Gould and General Sickles on behalf of the Erie, "that bygones should be bygones."[^20] Even so, they decided only reluctantly to co-operate with the McHenry group.

On acquiring control, McHenry was immediately confronted with grave financial problems. On the very first day after the Gould overthrow, the Erie's floating-debt creditors pressed for immediate payment. Thus, the first Gould surrender of control of a majority property was accompanied by a floating debt—a phenomenon that was destined to recur on many subsequent occasions. Each fresh group of investors was surprised over the existence of a floating debt well secured; in fact, secured in such a way as to diminish the security of the company's mortgage debts, in which more was invested than in the floating debt.

There were no funds available to pay the Erie's call loans, and McHenry's banking firm in London played the role of the protective shepherd which Drew had played a few years before. Word was rushed to London that funds were necessary, and through McHenry, the firm immediately advanced $2,000,000 secured by Erie bonds. Shortly thereafter, the same additional amount was made available. Later, the same firm sold a block of Erie consolidated bonds, from the proceeds of which it retained a large sum as a commission for the sale of the bonds and for its services in ousting the Gould-controlled Erie board.[^21]

The Gould tyrant was now overthrown. The Erie itself was still a financial derelict. The Atlantic was of no financial aid to the Erie. The Erie furthermore had lost valuable traffic from the lines sold by Gould to the Northern Central. The Erie was desperate, unable to pay a large call loan, with scarcely sufficient funds to maintain itself on a day-to-day basis. The Gould overthrow brought hope to the hearts of thousands; informed opinion, however, was not entirely misled. Traders and investors who observed affairs carefully had ample notice of the character of the change. One of the leading eastern railroad journals declared that the overthrow was "much like that of sneak-thieves purloining the plunder of high-way robbers; . . ."[^22] and an observer in Philadelphia characterized the overthrow as a "gamble and a sham."[^23]

A large part of the financial world, however, construed the overthrow as a prelude to greater things. The remarks of a Philadelphia commercial weekly were typical. "The blow has at last fallen with crushing force upon the Erie Ring, which has gone down, stunned and helpless, never to rise again."[^24] Traders, speculators and investors on world financial markets—London, Paris, Frankfort, New York—rushed to buy Erie. They ignored realities and looked solely to future blessings. They would buy now and assure themselves of participation in the road's coming prosperity. This sort of guessing contest is characterized as discounting the future. When in the future the expected good things come to be true, the price of the stock no longer rises. Many people believe this now, and many believed it in 1872. In the week before the overthrow, the stock fluctuated in a narrow range, but in the week following the overthrow, the stock advanced in heavy volume. In four days following the Gould removal, almost 300,000 shares (out of 780,000 shares outstanding) exchanged hands;[^25] while in eight days following the ouster, six-sevenths of the stock was traded. In London the price advanced further and dealings in the stock on the Exchange were described as "enormous."[^26]

Both the overthrowers and the overthrown, the rescuers and the rescued, participated in these heavy trading transactions. By its optimistic reports the new Erie executive committee (controlled by McHenry) fanned speculative hopes. It reported, for example, that after an examination of the books it had discovered that Erie earnings had been underestimated. The news was widely publicized both in this country and abroad. In the rise of Erie stock, McHenry's banking firm benefited handsomely. Between the dates of the overthrow in March and the annual stockholders' election in July, McHenry's bankers traded in and out of Erie a half-dozen times, while other bankers and the Heath and Raphael group also took part in the speculative excitement.[^27] Gould also participated in this speculative enthusiasm. Late in March he announced that he had conveyed the title of the Grand Opera to the Erie. The property had cost him nothing and it had been rented to the Erie at a high rental. As a result of this "Opera House comedy,"[^28] Erie rose from less than 51 on the twenty-third of March to almost 66 on the twenty-sixth. In the heavy trading English and German investors bought, and Gould sold. Gould realized profits of $3,250,000 on the advance.[^29]

While these profits were being taken the Erie itself remained in a desperate condition. No economic theory explaining values over either long-term or short-term or in static or dynamic markets can explain these fluctuations in price and value which have no relationship to the world of realities. Under the influence partly of misrepresentation and partly in hope of Erie prosperity, shareholders the world over bought Erie stock. Hope, however, could not induce traffic to flow to the Erie, nor raise rates, nor re-establish and maintain earnings.

As railroad operators in charge of the destinies of both the Erie and the Atlantic, the McHenry group, aside from maintaining the company's solvency, had two major problems to solve. First it was essential to secure permanent control, for McHenry, like Gould after the Vanderbilt settlement in July of 1868, had not been elected by the stockholders. To secure permanent tenure, a circular issued in London stated that it was considered desirable to place the Erie's shares in the hands of a committee in exchange for the committee's certificates.[^30] A London Erie office was organized, known as the "London Directors." This was an extralegal organization with no relationship to the Erie, and was not responsible for any of its promises or for any of its contracts. The stockholders nevertheless were asked to deposit their stock, and to sign an agreement by which the expenses of this group would come out of the Erie treasury. Those who deposited their stock surrendered their voting power. The "London Directors" were controlled by McHenry and his banker. After their experience with Gould, many stockholders again surrendered their independence to a new controller. Most of the English stock, however, was controlled by the Heath-Raphael group whose main object was to unseat Gould. Though McHenry had accomplished this, they liked neither him nor his extralegal methods. The alternative to co-operation with McHenry was an open fight, and so, true to banking instincts, they co-operated by surrender, thereby giving McHenry a proxy of 150,000 shares. With this help McHenry was successful. At the annual election in July, 1872, although having little stock of his own, he secured an Erie board of his own choice.

In order to recover misappropriated funds, the McHenry-controlled Erie management instituted legal proceedings. It discovered, however, that Gould was more than a match in ingenuity and judicial experience. Since the Gould overthrow in March, the Erie's books had been examined. The Erie informed the court that in the three and a half years of Gould's control more than $40,000,000 par value of Erie stock had been sold, and of the proceeds the road had received only a nominal amount, whereas Gould and his group had received more than $12,000,000. Since the Erie books were in wretched shape little could be proved in court. The sales of the Erie shares had been accounted for on the books of brokerage houses, primarily Smith, Gould, Martin & Co. These books, however, were not in the hands of the Erie nor could it gain access to them. The suits dragged along and nothing happened.

Meanwhile, with the Erie under McHenry's control, the construction program of the Atlantic lagged. The declaration of peace between the warring trunk lines in March, 1872, after the South Improvement fiasco which appeared to give each line, including the Erie, an opportunity to get a fair share of the growing oil traffic, had broken down. The Pennsylvania and the Lake Shore were getting more oil business at the expense of the Atlantic and the Erie. Early in August, McHenry arrived in the United States to unify more closely the operations of the Atlantic and the Erie and to wage a war for control of the oil traffic. Since McHenry was interested in immediate financial aid to help him in this struggle, he preferred to make a deal with Gould now and get less, than to engage in litigation and some years later get more.

Gould by this time had realized handsome profits from his trading in the Erie stock and had again become, for the first time since the gold panic in September, 1869, one of the leading traders of the day. In his trading activities Gould fell out with his business partner, Smith, and they took opposite sides in the market. While Gould bought, Smith in conjunction with Drew sold short. Gould soon learned that Smith was short of Chicago and Northwestern.[^31] He had also discovered a bull pool in that stock. Early in 1872 a Vanderbilt group, Clark and Schell, were engaged in a campaign to acquire control of the Northwestern[^32] and, to carry out their objective, had borrowed several millions from Europe.

Gould's discovery of the short position of Smith and Drew was a stroke of fortune to Clark and Schell. With all their borrowings, the price of Northwestern in September and October did not materially advance. Gould brought the good news of the existence of the heavy short interest in Northwestern to the two operators and an alliance was formed among the three. The Northwestern market began to move mysteriously. "The eccentric career of the stock," declared one market observer, was "a conundrum to the street."[^33]

Smith by this time had heavy paper losses on his short sales. Realizing that Gould had trapped him, he thought for a way out of his predicament, and his thoughts fell on the books of the ex-brokerage firm of Smith, Gould, Martin & Co. Here, he thought, was the incriminating evidence that would send Gould to the penitentiary. If bail could be made heavy enough, Gould might be hustled off, and in his absence a break in the market would enable Smith to buy back the stock he had sold short, and thus avoid the heavy losses that then confronted him. The Erie management was also confident that if the books of the brokerage firm could be produced, a conclusive case against Gould could be made. Smith accordingly located the missing books, and delivered them to Barlow, Erie's counsel, who after an examination, was convinced that he had proof to convict Gould. Since Sickle's release of Gould in March, 1872, had not been approved by the board of directors,[^34] Barlow contended, it was void.

Barlow now moved quickly and by November 22 the order for Gould's arrest was ready. The Gould complaint reiterated not only the old charge that the Erie had sold more than 400,000 shares and had received little of the proceeds, but it also included a new complaint, viz., that Smith, Gould, Martin & Co. owed the Erie $3,000,000. Gould, according to the complaint, had transferred this amount to himself on the ground that the Erie owed him this sum. The complaint added some new details of Gould's wrongdoings. On one occasion, he lost over $359,000 speculating in Reading stock, and on another over $13,000 in New York Central—both losses being charged to the Erie.[^35]

Gould knew what was going on. For days he had been closeted with Clark and Schell planning details of the Northwestern market movements. On November 22 the stock opened at 98½, and after declining to 95, suddenly rocketed on a purchase of 4,700 shares. In the afternoon about thirty minutes before the close of trading, the sheriff appeared in Gould's offices. When Gould left to go to the sheriff's office, Northwestern was selling at 105. Shortly thereafter, when trading closed for the day, the stock was bid 200 with none offered.[^36] Gould's bail of $1,000,000 was immediately provided by his partners, Clark and Schell, and Gould was released. On the day following the stock was bought in for the parties short who had failed to deliver on their contracts. The price moved on successive transactions as follows: 155, 200, 199, 200, 206, 212, 230, 225, 229, and 230. 64,000 shares were bought in for the account of two firms that did business for Drew, and it was estimated that Drew lost about $2,000,000, and Smith even more.[^37]

Though the arrest of Gould was tragic to Drew and Smith, it was an occasion for rejoicing to the Erie. "The criminals may be brought to justice,"[^38] was the triumphant cry of that organ of railroad opinion that had picturesquely condemned the Erie rescue of March, 1872. This, however, was a pious hope. Gould was indeed arrested and the charges against him were serious. The directors and managers of the Erie in 1872 were anxious for a settlement. Gould was out on bail. The Erie directors were willing to negotiate—and so was Gould. Gould had in his possession a motley collection of securities. He also owned real estate in Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and elsewhere. Neither securities nor real estate had cost Gould much. The securities which were associated largely with the operation of the Erie seemed to have considerable value. Concerning these properties, according to the Erie's counsel years later, it appeared to the Erie to be "of vital importance that the title and possession should be acquired by the company as soon as possible without awaiting the result of the long litigation and the complications which [might] arise in the meantime pending litigation."[^39]

Here is the typical philosophy of compromisers. A fight in court would take too long and might result in failure. Peace might be long postponed. Indeed, to the weak heart and laggard soul, it might never come. In the interests of a quick peace and an immediate settlement, therefore, let the aggressor be mollified and his terms accepted.

So on December 18, 1872, the great compromise was arranged. Gould turned over to the Erie a mess of securities. The famous Opera House was valued at $1,500,000, while other pieces of real estate were inventoried at the same amount.[^40] Another asset turned over to the Erie was $1,000,000 of the stock of the United States Express Company which had a contract with the Erie; but the stock was destined never to be delivered to the Erie since Gould never had the stock. He had only a contract with the company by which the company, in return for certain considerations, had promised to deliver the stock. Gould passed this contract over to the Erie, but since Gould had not carried out the conditions of the contract, this item of $1,000,000 in the settlement was worth nothing.[^41]

The settlement, contrary to the so-called rescue in March, was hailed on all sides as genuine. The Erie management was happy—so happy that it made no investigation of the value of the securities. Reflecting their judgment that large sums had been recovered for the road, the board directed the opening on the books of a Reclamation Account with a credit balance of approximately $9,000,000. Even as late as the spring of 1874, the road's management stated that in order to improve the Erie's bad physical condition, it had charged expenses for repairs to the Reclamation Account.[^42]

The actual value of the securities which the Erie received in exchange for relieving Gould from liability for damages was not recognized for some years. All authoritative evidence assured the investors, traders, and speculators that the Erie had been enriched. The Erie was badly in need of funds and the new wealth would add to the value of Erie shares. Immediately, and in excited trading, the price of Erie rose sharply to reflect the increased value of the company's assets. Gould added to the trading excitement. Resorting to his technique of indirection and suggestion, he arranged an interview and raised buoyant hopes for the future. Since he was allied with Clark, president of the Lake Shore, the Erie now could negotiate a traffic route with that line, and eliminate its dependence upon the Atlantic. The credit of the Erie, he said, had been "renewed tenfold." And finally Gould came to the vital point: the Erie board, he said, would give him the first market bid for 200,000 shares, although just how the board could control the market was not explained. Gould had not finished his list of imaginative suggestions; he hinted that he would use his influence with the Northwestern to send traffic over the Erie.[^43] Thus the Lake Shore and the Northwestern would become new and powerful Erie allies—and all through Gould's influence. His purchase of all or part of 200,000 shares of Erie would of course elevate the price of Erie.

The very next day, however, Barlow, Erie's counsel, brought the traders back to a sense of reality. He denied the entire Gould tale of the preferred market for 200,000 shares, and the various agreements between the Erie and other roads. What Gould meant by his lurid suggestion of a bid for 200,000 shares is not clear. Perhaps it was designed to lead people to believe that he was about to execute an order for the purchase of Erie stock large enough to induce a rise in price of substantial proportions. Gould did have some stock, for in a letter to the president of the Erie on the day before the settlement he wrote that he had "a large pecuniary interest" in the Erie.[^44] But the reported call for 200,000 Erie was probably a Gould canard.

Whatever the truth, the settlement produced a lively market. The reaction was not as powerful as it had been in March. Despite the official seal set on the claim of large Erie recoveries, there were many doubters. Expectations of the Erie increase in traffic and earnings, so widely entertained in March, had not been fully borne out by events. In the ten days of heavy trading following the December settlement, Erie advanced from 52 to about 60. Perhaps Gould made some profits, though they were not large.

It was not until the summer of 1874, largely through the work of accountants who examined the books of the Erie on behalf of the London shareholders committee, that the real value of the property delivered by Gould was determined. Plenty of hindsight criticism soon developed. Additional suits against Gould began to drag their way through the courts. Meanwhile the company dropped into receivership. The receiver, who was also president, finally submitted for the court's approval terms of another settlement. By this time (1876) Gould had recovered his losses and had become a leading railroad man. By the terms of this settlement, he was able to afford the Erie some real value and the court therefore approved the settlement. Gould gave the receiver 5,000 shares of United States Express and about $500,000 of Northern Central bonds, and he also relieved the Grand Opera House of its mortgage.[^45]

Gould's escape from the legal obligations imposed upon him by his misappropriations is a tribute partly to his resourcefulness and partly to his ability to interpret the motives of human nature. Although the value of Erie recoveries in the first settlement were indeed small, the recoveries made by the Erie were more than nominal. An officer of the road some seven years after the first settlement estimated that the securities (not the real estate) were probably worth not more than $200,000Here's the continuation of the formatted chapter:
