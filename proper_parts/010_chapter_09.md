# Chapter IX - Gould Merges the Union Pacific

The transformation of Gould from a trader into a business leader of national proportions was one of the most startling events in American business history. His accomplishments in the three years of 1879, 1880 and 1881 were unprecedented in the business and financial life of the country, and in a sense have never been repeated since that time. Gould, unlike Harriman twenty years later, did not have the support of commercial and investment banks, nor did he have any aggregation of investment capital at his command. Gould financed his startling success of corporate acquisitions primarily by stock-market profits. He borrowed funds from the bank on margin in the same way that the ordinary stock-market trader does, and he pyramided his borrowings along strictly conventional lines. By the skillful shifting of his security holdings he was able to exercise dominant control over a surprisingly large number of corporations. He succeeded indeed in lifting himself up by his financial boot straps. The effect of his activities on the business as well as the economic life of the country was far-reaching. He became the competitive bull thrown into the stabilized china shops, overturning rate compacts from the Rockies to the seaboard. He built new roads into territories long considered monopolistic havens by others, thereby setting off a long train of economic factors in the form of competitive building, overexpansion, heavy financial losses and pronounced railroad rate reductions.

The event that enabled him to assume leadership in the railroad industry was the sale of a large block of his Union Pacific stock. In the fall of 1878 when his trading losses were heavy, and when his major, almost his sole, asset consisted of his large block of Union Pacific, he had made an effort to sell some of it to the Northwestern and the Rock Island. The two companies were asked to buy about 10,000 shares each with the understanding that both should have representation on the Union Pacific's board. Both roads, however, concluded that they would consider no proposal that did not include the Burlington, their sister road in the Iowa Pool, on an equal footing. They therefore asked Forbes of the Burlington whether it would be wise or practicable for the three pool roads to entertain such a proposal. Forbes rejected the idea and instead raised the question whether the funds might not be more profitably applied to buy and hold each other's securities rather than those of the Union Pacific. The natural alliance, Forbes thought, was with the pool lines instead of with the Union Pacific. Instead of the pool roads aligning themselves with the Union Pacific, he believed that the existing alliance between themselves should be made more permanent. Forbes preferred to use the five-million-dollar surplus of the Burlington to buy into the Rock Island and the Northwestern rather than to buy the Union Pacific stock at 66. Forbes moreover reflected his usual suspicion of the ambitious Gould, and observed that the proposed transaction was made to bring on some negotiation, and that there was no foundation for the judgment that Gould meant to sell his stock.[^010_1]

Gould did not thus succeed in selling his Union Pacific stock. Nevertheless in the face of his paper losses and of the 50 per cent bank write-down of his Union Pacific collateral, he loomed up in the middle of February, 1879, as a leader in the infant bull market. On February 17 the financial community was treated to a typical Gould sensation. Less than four years after the market stir generated by the Pacific Mail-Union Pacific alliance, he announced the sale of a large block of Union Pacific to a syndicate led by Sage and Keene at a price of from $65 to $70 a share. The effect on the Union Pacific stock was immediate. It opened at 68¼ on the morning of the seventeenth, and within a few minutes moved to 78⅛. Not until late in the day was the news of the sale published. The transaction was negotiated and completed in secrecy.

Gould's financial problems were solved overnight. His losses on the short side of Northwestern were settled by delivery of Union Pacific at prices below the market.

Though newspapers and periodicals freely discussed Gould's future actions, nobody correctly envisaged the extraordinary turn his career was about to take. He moved simultaneously in the field of corporate acquisitions on a widespread front from the eastern seaboard to the base of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. For convenience of discussion these operations will be divided into the following groups: those affecting the transcontinental railroads from the Missouri River to eastern Colorado; those affecting the middle-western roads from the Missouri River to Chicago and Toledo; those affecting the southwestern railroads from St. Louis and Kansas City to El Paso, Texas, and the Gulf of Mexico; and finally those affecting the eastern roads from Buffalo to New York and to New England. The transcontinental roads will be examined in this chapter, and the other roads will be separately considered in successive chapters.

The transcontinental scene in 1878 and 1879 was still dominated by the conflict between Gould and the Burlington. The latter recognized more than ever that it was essential to build a line to Denver. From Kansas City it could reach Denver either via the Atchison or the Kansas Pacific, and from Omaha it was dependent for access to that rapidly growing traffic center upon the circuitous line of the Union Pacific. Forbes was therefore interested in the acquisition of the Kansas Pacific as a means of giving the Burlington its Denver connection. Forbes, however, was not aggressive. The environment of depression continued to weigh heavily upon him. When John Duff, a leading railroad speculator of Boston, asked him to aid Villard to secure control of the Kansas Pacific, Forbes declined. He suggested that Villard open the way with the Atchison, and after he had the road carefully examined by railroad experts, and "without committing ourselves to it," it would be worth taking individually an interest in the Kansas Pacific.[^010_2] Though his conclusion was well worthy of his New England conservatism, it was not of course a solution to the reorganization battle and offered no hope to Villard.

Forbes was not, in short, a professional risk-taker. Though he was anxious to negotiate a trade, he was not ready as a businessman to assume a heavy risk in the heart of a depression in order to accomplish a far-reaching business goal.

Gould, on the contrary, united both of these abilities. He was at once a professional risk-taker and a businessman. As a trader, he put up his own funds and enlisted the active support of other speculators. As a businessman he examined an existing railroad or drew plans for the building of a new one; he then reached independent judgments based upon the existing and prospective value of a railroad as an active business unit. While Forbes was examining and hesitating, Gould assumed the offensive, invested his funds, shouldered the burdens and dictated the pattern of business diplomacy.

The Kansas Pacific was not the only property that Forbes was examining in the spring of 1878 as a means of protecting the strategic position of the Burlington. He had his eye also upon the St. Joseph & Denver City. Harris in the fall of 1877 had expressed fear that the Union Pacific in control of that road could coerce the Iowa lines into taking positions they would not otherwise take. It would then be as much to the interest of the Union Pacific to trade at St. Joseph as at Council Bluffs.[^010_3]

While Forbes was making preliminary inquiries into the value of the Kansas Pacific and the St. Joseph & Denver City railroads, Gould suddenly struck in southern Nebraska. A gentleman's agreement between the Union Pacific and the B. & M. had for a number of years stabilized their competitive positions in the region south of the Platte River. In May, 1878, Gould broke the peace by filing amended articles for the organization of subsidiary corporations to cover the territory with new roads. Forbes was not yet ready to start a war of competitive construction. Villard, who according to a Burlington official knew what Gould wanted, offered to negotiate a settlement. Villard thought he could come to an agreement with Gould on the division of territory, but he accomplished nothing and the Burlington party struck back. Early in July the B. & M. announced its intention to build roads further west in southern Nebraska.[^010_4]

Neither the Burlington nor the Union Pacific, however, was ready for actual warfare. Though they had revealed their intentions to build, they refrained from putting those intentions into action. Neither party dared to commit itself, and their announcements accordingly were not followed by the laying of rails.

Meanwhile Forbes maintained a continuous interest in the St. Joseph problem. The bridge at that point was owned by a company then in receivership. Control of both the bridge and of the St. Joseph & Denver City was for sale. In the negotiations that followed Gould got in ahead and bought both the railroad and the bridge.

The grand traffic prize to the Burlington, however, was neither the bridge nor the road, but rather the Kansas Pacific. In February, 1879, after the sale of Union Pacific stock to the syndicate, Gould retained his Kansas Pacific holdings. Although the finances and earning power of the road were weak, strategically it was important. If Gould secured control, he had hopes of uniting it with the Union Pacific on a basis which would make its stock and junior bonds valuable. The competitive and strategic problems were complex. On the east, the Pennsylvania under the guardianship of Scott was an ever-threatening factor, and on the west, the aggressive Atchison presented other competitive possibilities. The Pennsylvania ended at St. Louis, while the Atchison began at Kansas City. If the Pennsylvania should acquire control of the Missouri Pacific, and the Atchison work in harmony with the Pennsylvania, a new competitive through route could be established. Such a combination could damage the Kansas Pacific. It was also possible that the Baltimore & Ohio, whose financial condition was of the best, might join with the Missouri Pacific and thus weaken Gould's rapidly growing power over the traffic movements between Kansas City and the Middle West. The Baltimore & Ohio, through corporate and individual holdings of its officers, had a heavy interest in the Ohio & Mississippi—then in receivership—which extended its system from Cincinnati to St. Louis.

As it turned out, none of these possibilities materialized. Garrett of the Baltimore & Ohio displayed his aggressive expansion plans in his independent fight against the telegraph, express, and sleeping-car companies. The Pennsylvania management was still haunted by losses occasioned by the rapid expansion from 1869 to the panic. The deficits on some of its leased lines were substantial, and only the able management of Scott and the heavy volume of local traffic enabled the company, in the depression years, to maintain its credit rating.

On the western end of the line Gould was also confronted by critical problems. In Colorado, the interest centered around the rapidly expanding mining business in an area in which Leadville was the major producer. The wealth of the region and the inward tide of immigration increased through the spring and summer of 1879 and between March and October probably 20,000 people entered the area.[^010_5] The mining boom found two local roads in the construction stage. Former Governor Evans, promoter of one road, the Denver and South Park,[^010_6] had the loyal support of a majority of its stockholders who had pooled their stock with a trustee. The other road was the Denver & Rio Grande,[^010_7] which had been projected as a north-and-south line from Denver to El Paso. Through the Kansas Pacific, Gould had relations with both roads. The Denver, which had been pushing south in 1878, found its career expansion blunted and later diverted by the powerful onrush of an able Boston group of managers and capitalists. The Atchison starting as a local road in eastern Kansas had developed great expansive power, and by 1876 it had reached Pueblo. A conflict developed between the Atchison and the Denver, and a lease of the latter by the former in October, 1878, apparently settled all outstanding problems. These indications, however, were deceptive. Both the lessee and the lessor had pushed west to pre-empt the San Juan mining region's traffic by building lines to Leadville. There was, however, only one practicable route, and that lay through a gorge in the Arkansas River Valley. Both roads disputed for possession of this right of way, and in September 1878 the court declared that both contestants could build duplicate lines. Sensible business judgment rose above legal permission, and shortly after the decision was rendered, both properties agreed upon a compromise. The lease soon followed.[^010_8]

To Gould, in the winter of 1878-79, this union of interests between the Denver and the Atchison appeared dangerous. Villard was still insisting upon the foreclosure of the Denver Extension mortgage. A traffic agreement between the Kansas Pacific and the newly formed association of the Atchison and the Denver would impair the earnings of the Union Pacific, and an agreement with the Burlington on the east would strengthen the combination. The new route could compete in eastern Colorado and move the profitable ore and bullion traffic over its own lines to Kansas City there to be forwarded over the Garrison-owned Missouri Pacific for further movement to St. Louis.

Gould in the winter of 1878-79, as he looked out upon this rapidly changing scene of railroad strategy, was relatively helpless. He had little cash and purchasing power. It was his sale of Union Pacific stock in February, 1879, which gave him both.

With this new supply of cash and credit Gould attacked the Kansas Pacific problem with renewed energy. Late in December, 1878, Villard appeared before a federal court and denounced the pooling agreement of 1878 between the Union Pacific and the Kansas Pacific. The pool, he insisted, worked to the disadvantage of the Kansas Pacific; it should be set aside, since it was "vicious" in itself and "monstrous" in its provisions for the future. The court postponed a decision to the March term of the court.

Gould was then planning the sale of his Union Pacific stock, and he knew that he would soon have cash. He recognized also that Villard's legal position had been established, as one observer stated it, "beyond the possibility of further dispute."[^010_9] The power of the Denver Extension bondholders to shut out by foreclosure proceedings the Kansas Pacific's junior security holders was now unchallenged. Gould had lost his battle to extract concessions from Villard, and he therefore opened negotiations to ascertain a basis for settlement. He had little time to lose since it was possible that during the March judicial term Villard, if his interests were not settled, might destroy the 1878 pool, foreclose the mortgage and wrest control of the property. A plan was finally evolved. Gould agreed on behalf of the junior security holders to pay all the interest arrearages on the Denver Extension bonds in cash, and to reduce the interest on the new bonds, to be exchanged par for par for the old, from 7 per cent to 6 per cent. This proposal Villard accepted, and the Denver Extension bonds which two years before had sold at 35, advanced to 102. Villard's leadership in his struggle was generally recognized. "It may be doubted," declared one contemporary writer, "whether any other great railroad property in this country, which has been actually in the hands of a receiver, can show so remarkable an advance as this." The bondholders united, continued the writer, in crediting Villard with this achievement.[^010_10]

Control of the road now rested with its junior securities, held largely by the Reorganizing Pool. After considerable negotiation, Gould bought out the other Pool investors, thereby securing a majority of the road's junior securities. Subject to the agreement with Villard, Gould now took control of the reorganization.

The significance of this development was not appreciated by the financial community. The Gould-Villard arrangement was construed as a victory for Villard. Actually, it was. The transfer of ownership of the Kansas Pacific junior securities to Gould was also construed as a defeat for Gould since, after all, title to the junior securities did not increase their value. The announcement of these Kansas Pacific arrangements, therefore, led to a sharp break in the price of its stock.

Gould, however, knew better. With Villard's threat of foreclosure removed, with most of the junior securities securely in his hands and with the merger of the road with the Union Pacific a distinct possibility, he decided to acquire more junior securities by open market purchases. Early in March Gould made his peace with Villard. Under the influence of Gould's buying, the price of the stock moved from less than 20 to a high of 58½ in late April. In the spring of 1875, and now again in the spring of 1879, the speculative following expressed thanks to Gould for profits rendered and received.

Gould by the early summer of 1879 had acquired a majority of the stock of the Kansas Pacific and had successfully reorganized the road. In his effort to unite it with the Union Pacific, however, he had not succeeded. In order to strengthen his hand in negotiating with the Union Pacific, he decided to improve the competitive position of the road. He therefore set before him the double task of breaking the Atchison lease of the Denver and acquiring control of the Denver Pacific. The latter road—the Kansas Pacific subsidiary in eastern Colorado—competed with a Union Pacific system line. The stock of the Denver Pacific at that time had little value; the road was in receivership, and paid no interest.

The steps Gould took to acquire control of the latter were carefully made, each being well adapted to an immediate end. No observer or critic understood the meaning of each step as it was made. Strangely enough he first worked through the Kansas Pacific. Almost as soon as its reorganization took place, he proposed a new financial scheme. A consolidated mortgage was authorized, designed to facilitate the conversion of existing bonds into new consolidated bonds—a scheme similar to the one that Gould had proposed in the summer of 1873 for the New Jersey Southern. The proposal was not attractive to the first mortgage bondholders, though the junior creditors gladly exchanged their pooled securities for bonds which were part of a larger issue and secured by a blanket mortgage. Such bonds had a wider and more active market than the numerous classes of existing bonds. Gould and his leading allies, Sage and Dillon, received these bonds in exchange for their pooled junior securities. Gould and Sage were named trustees of the consolidated mortgage. Slightly less than 30,000 of the 40,000 Denver Pacific shares outstanding, as well as some relatively worthless securities of smaller properties, were deposited as additional security for the new mortgage bonds.[^010_11] The two trustees and the additional collateral security appeared to be relatively unimportant, and at the time were overlooked. They eventually proved to be the key which unlocked the mystery of the new mortgage. The Denver Pacific stock seemed to be without value. In July, 1879, the court, at the request of the bondholders, had ordered the foreclosure of the mortgage and the sale of the property. When, therefore, Gould a few weeks later purchased a big block of the Denver Pacific bonds held in Amsterdam, the brokers in that city were "astonished."[^010_12] Gould, however, had his reasons, and he was careful not to enlighten the astonished brokers. His negotiations for the acquisition of the bonds were rapid and conclusive. "I got in there [Amsterdam]," said Gould some years later before the Pacific Railway Commission, "in the morning at ten o'clock, and got my breakfast, and let them know I was there and they met me at eleven o'clock, and at twelve o'clock I bought them out and paid them."[^010_13]

Gould, as the largest holder of the bonds, could control the impending foreclosure, thus eliminating the value of the stock. This obvious view was of course the one assumed by the average observer. Gould did not follow this view, and before the end of the calendar year he had devised an ingenious scheme by which the seemingly worthless stock became even more valuable than the seemingly worthless bonds.

While negotiating for the Denver Pacific's securities, Gould did not overlook the necessity of breaking the Atchison's lease of the Denver. In the spring of 1879 William J. Palmer (president of the Denver) and his party, which included an agent of Perkins, continued to press forward with the fight against the lease. The lessor insisted that the lease was invalid, and that it had a prior claim to the right of way through the canyon. The lessee disputed both claims. The security holders of the lessor declared furthermore that traffic was being diverted to the South Park. This claim was also denied by the lessee. Suits and countersuits, the appointment of receivers, the seizure of parts of each other's property, the ordering of the militia for action in the event of violence, the holding of the lessor in contempt of court, were actions reminiscent of the Erie-Vanderbilt struggle.

The Burlington watched this struggle with keen interest. Perkins thought of making peace between William B. Strong of the Atchison and Palmer of the Denver, and then contracting for the joint ownership of the road. "I don't know but my imagination may be heated," wrote Perkins, "but I can't help believing that would be a wise combination."[^010_14] Perkins's mind went even beyond the idea of the union of these two roads; he believed that the interests of all the Boston roads should be harmonized, a consummation which would have had serious repercussions on Gould. For Boston, wrote Perkins, was a pet aversion to Gould; a Boston railroad seemed to have "the same disagreeable influence upon him that holy water [was] said to have on his great prototype."[^010_15] The Atchison, meanwhile, defeated in court in its efforts to control the right of way through the Grand Canyon, appealed the decision. Its position remained uncertain, and in order to assure control of the mining region it made a bid for the stock control of the Denver. Gould, appreciating his danger, entered the lists as a competitor. In this struggle Gould was successful. Late in September he succeeded in buying one-half of the Denver's voting trust certificates at 22, payable at his option either in cash, Kansas Pacific stock at 66, or Kansas Pacific Consolidated bonds at 88.[^010_16]

At the same time, the Atchison lost also in its attempt to control the other potential line to Leadville—the South Park. That road had earned scarcely more than its operating expenses, but in the summer of 1879 its earnings began to rise. The stockholders became optimistic and raised the offering price to the Atchison. The latter refused to pay. Gould meanwhile increased his stock holdings by purchases from counties in the territory served. His influence over the road's policies grew, while the Atchison's influence disappeared.

Gould had out-traded his opponent on all points. He now had an interest in both the north and south lines into the Leadville district, thereby increasing the strategic power of the Kansas Pacific. In the fall of 1879 boom was at its height. The South Park began payment of dividends, while the earnings of the Denver rose. Gould, therefore, controlled an important volume of business for his Kansas Pacific, and what was more important, the volume gave promise of increase. Although the road was still operating at a loss in the fall of 1879, its traffic position was improving. Gould believed his position was sufficiently strong to enable him to solve the competitive problems between the Union and the Kansas Pacific on the basis of consolidation. The idea was not new, it had been discussed for some years.

Accordingly in September he again proposed the sale of the road to the Union Pacific. The Union Pacific board considered the price suggested by Gould excessive and accordingly rejected his proposal. The board based its policies upon the questionable assumption that the road would continue to make interchange agreements with existing lines.

When his proposals to unite the two roads were rejected, Gould left for the West. By this time, late in September, he had working control of the new Wabash system, which was building a line, a circuitous one it is true, to Chicago, while Gould was negotiating for a connection from Toledo to Detroit. He was also engaged with Vanderbilt, the controlling interest in the New York Central system, in a struggle for other Wabash connections, which was to end soon in victory.[^010_17] Other than the Wabash, only the Missouri Pacific and the St. Louis & San Francisco[^010_18] connected Kansas City and St. Louis. The latter's line was indirect and unprofitable. The Missouri Pacific, however, controlled a direct line. Gould's rapid moves in the preceding few months had impaired its competitive position. In control of the Kansas Pacific, Gould could divert eastbound business at Kansas City from the Missouri Pacific to the newly organized Wabash. At St. Louis, as the dominant factor in the affairs of the latter, he could divert westbound business to the competitors of Garrison's Missouri Pacific.

Garrison was not the type of man to take this turn of affairs calmly. On the western end of the Missouri Pacific there were a number of unfinished stubs, which had attracted his attention as they had Gould's. They were either in receivership or in financial difficulties. Garrison, in May of 1879, had bought the controlling interest in one of these small lines—the Kansas Central—which owned a line west from Leavenworth, Kansas. By relatively short connections with the Union Pacific and the B. & M. he could make serious inroads into the business of the Kansas Pacific.

Another of the unfinished stub ends in Kansas was the Central Branch Union Pacific.[^010_19] Despite its name it had no corporate relationship to the Union Pacific. Its promoters had planned to connect it with the Union Pacific, but when the Kansas Pacific was extended to Denver, the stock lost most of its value, and in the language of one of its builders, the stock then was not worth ten cents on the dollar.[^010_20] In 1877 a new management led by R. M. Pomeroy took hold. Even though the property was in receivership, the management initiated an expansion policy, and in 1879 organized a company to build a line to Denver. Because of its heavy debt and the few shares outstanding, a relatively small drop in profits eliminated its per share earnings, while a relatively small rise rapidly sharply increased those earnings. The heavy grain crop of 1879 accompanied by a rise in prices multiplied its earnings per share.

Despite its expansion policy, the large stockholders were willing to sell. At least four buyers appeared. Vanderbilt, in his hit-and-miss fashion, declared that he was anxious to buy, presumably as part of his plan to deliver a blow to Gould in the war over the Wabash. Perhaps he also wanted to strike at the Kansas Pacific in order to bring pressure on Gould in the East. Against Vanderbilt and his wealth appeared the veteran manipulator, Garrison, and the sharp bargainer, Gould. Garrison saw in the Central Branch an opportunity to extend the Missouri Pacific from Kansas City to Denver. Such an extension would reduce the traffic of the Kansas Pacific, impair the market value of its stock, and thus prejudice his plan of merging that road with the Union Pacific. Gould therefore was forced to buy: defensively, to protect the Denver business of the Kansas Pacific, and offensively, to give him another weapon with which to fight the Union Pacific. The Burlington also appeared as a buyer of the Central Branch.

Gould opened negotiations with the controlling holders through Oliver Ames who had inherited a large block of stock from his father, one of the founders of the Union Pacific. Ames traded shrewdly and succeeded in selling the stock to Gould at a fancy price averaging $239 per share. Gould transferred these shares to the Union Pacific at the cost to him.

Garrison's ambition to expand his Missouri Pacific west of Kansas City was thereby blocked, if not stopped. He could now expand only through the construction of new lines. Directly and through agents Gould had been negotiating for control of the Missouri Pacific for some weeks. Some of these interviews were stormy. Garrison insisted there was no basis for a compromise, and that he was determined to expand west of Kansas City. Gould's acquisition of the Central Branch, however, changed the situation in his favor, and after negotiations which lasted three months, the trade was finally made. The price he paid for the stock was, on the basis of established earnings undoubtedly excessive, as it had been for the Central Branch. The road, however, was strategically located, and with a large flow of business, earnings on the small stock issue promised to increase rapidly and enhance the value of each share.

Gould now dominated both of the direct Kansas City-St. Louis lines. To perfect his trading position with the Union Pacific it was necessary for him to control also the road in southern Nebraska and northeastern Kansas, which gave the Union Pacific a short line to St. Louis. The key to this situation lay at St. Joseph, Missouri. The St. Joseph & Denver City and the bridge at St. Joseph were the two vital properties. By June, Gould in a trading duel with Forbes of the Burlington had succeeded in buying control of both.

By the first week of December, 1879, Gould had thus strengthened the strategic position of the Kansas Pacific at its eastern end. To complete the southern ring around the Union Pacific, he now proposed to extend the recently acquired Missouri Pacific from Atchison to St. Joseph, and the Central Branch to a connection with the Kansas Pacific, thus making a new short route from Denver to the Missouri River.

To hem in and to demoralize the Union Pacific even further, Gould also proposed to extend the Kansas Pacific to Ogden, there to connect with the Central Pacific. This new line might lead to a war of rates, and Gould's record in the railroad world was sufficient evidence to any doubter that he would not hesitate to carry such a war to its uttermost lengths.

These were the plans that confronted the Union Pacific board late in December. The board was on the defensive, and it was not necessary for Gould to make the advances. He knew his power and awaited offers; the offers soon came. The Union Pacific proposed a consolidation with the Kansas Pacific, and on Gould's terms. The board was willing to exchange a share of stock of the Union Pacific—a solvent dividend paying security—for a share of the Kansas Pacific, for years a non-interest-paying property and in receivership, and recently reorganized. Gould, however, was reluctant and refused to consolidate. He wanted to convert the Kansas Pacific-Missouri Pacific system into a new transcontinental route. He therefore refused to sell; the Union Pacific insisted. The board took the ground that Gould "was bound by his previous conversations to give [the Union Pacific] the preference, and to let the [Union Pacific] take the property if [the Union Pacific] could agree upon the terms."[^010_21]

Gould understood the strength of his position. He knew that while the Kansas Pacific was not financially strong, as a threat to its competitor it had the strength of Samson. If its terms were not met, it could lay low both the strong and the weak. Another overland line would, it is true, perpetuate the insolvency of the Kansas Pacific; but in due course it would also insure the insolvency of the Union Pacific.

With the Union Pacific on the defensive and begging for terms, Gould's dramatic sense must have been stimulated. Far more important, however, was the stimulation of his ingenuity and financial resourcefulness. Aside from the Kansas Pacific he had a number of other poverty-stricken roads that he was determined to exchange for the high-grade Union Pacific stock. First, was the apparently worthless stock of the Denver Pacific, and second, that valueless stock of the St. Joseph bridge and road, though in later years both came to be valuable. The latter had a strategic value as part of a short Union Pacific route to St. Louis. The former—the Denver Pacific—had slight value except as a competitive bludgeon in the hands of Gould. If its stock could be released from the trust and placed in the treasury of the Kansas Pacific, no violation of the trust would result; the stock would be returned to its rightful owner, the Kansas Pacific. Furthermore, with the stock in the Kansas Pacific treasury as a free asset, it could be exchanged if the Union Pacific was willing, for Union Pacific stock, and Gould would see to it that the Union Pacific was willing. Upon receipt of the Union Pacific stock by the Kansas Pacific, the latter could exchange it for the securities of the St. Joseph properties which were held by Gould.

Gould's immediate task, therefore, was to remove the Denver Pacific stock from the trustees of the consolidated mortgage. Since judicial proceedings are slow and long-drawn-out, the release of stock from a trust within a few days is usually a difficult task. In this case, however, the legal machinery moved fast, and within ten days, as officially described by the Pacific Railway Commission, "A suit was manufactured, in which the Kansas Pacific Railway Company was made the plaintiff, and Jay Gould and Russell Sage the defendants, and the entire machinery of complaint, answer, trial, decree, and execution was carried to a finish...."[^010_22] The court ordered Gould and Sage, trustees for the consolidated mortgage bondholders, to return the Denver Pacific stock to the Kansas Pacific treasury.

The way was thus opened for the merger on Gould's terms. The contract was made on January 4, 1880. The Kansas Pacific and the Denver Pacific stocks, together with the Union Pacific stock, were exchanged par for par into the stock of a new company—the Union Pacific Railway Company. Though the operating mileage and the gross revenue of the Union Pacific was increased, its finances and earnings were weakened.

In these negotiations, Gould resumed the trading position he had so often occupied on the Erie—that of representing both buyer and seller. He owned almost one-half of the Kansas Pacific and was also a small holder of the Union Pacific stock. Adverse interests on the Erie had produced stinging denunciations from Adams in his famous Chapters on the Erie. Strange to say, however, the Union Pacific-Kansas Pacific-Denver Pacific merger brought no such criticism from this source. The Union Pacific, insisted Adams, gave no "larger consideration" for Kansas Pacific than the Missouri Pacific was willing and anxious to give. "It cannot be fairly argued," he maintained in defending the merger before the Pacific Railway Commission in 1887, "that the director of one railroad company, who is likewise interested in the stock of another railroad company of which he is also a director, is called upon to sell to the first company his interest in the securities of the second company for a less price than someone else is willing to give. He is merely called upon not to take advantage of his position as a director to get for his property more than it would bring in the outside market."[^010_23]

Whatever ground there may be for this fine-spun distinction, the effects of this, and of the Erie, transactions were the same. Gould's business strategy in the Union Pacific trade was almost perfect. He threw the Union Pacific board suddenly and almost without warning into a defensive position from which there was no retreat. He left no basis for either compromise or alternative. The merger of the Union Pacific and the Kansas Pacific revolutionized Gould's bargaining power against the Atchison. Except for that road he exerted an influence in every line in eastern Colorado.

Although early 1880 found the Denver still in receivership and under lease to the Atchison, the stockholders had repudiated the lease. In the face of adverse legal decisions, the Atchison refused to surrender its right to expand into the rich mining areas of southern Colorado. The relative privileges of both lessor and lessee had not yet been judicially decided, and the court had appointed a commission which was still holding hearings and gathering evidence. The mineral traffic of the disputed region was described in the 1880 annual report of the Denver as "a principality in itself." The area had gold, silver and lead, as well as "enormous" coal fields, and was a "vast store-house of splendid timber."[^010_24] The Atchison was determined to press the issue.

While the court proceeded leisurely to gather the facts and formulate an opinion, it took more advanced ground, renewing its threat to build a line from Pueblo paralleling the Denver road. Gould, however, was not idle. While his trunk line opponent was making its thrust, he was preparing a counterthrust. Sharpening his effective weapon—the threat of parallel construction—he announced the organization of a new property (naming it the Pueblo & St. Louis), to build a line paralleling the Atchison from Pueblo to Ft. Dodge, Kansas, a distance of about 266 miles. On the west of the Atchison, he announced that the line of the Denver would be further extended without delay to Utah and beyond. These additional extensions by the Denver and the Pueblo & St. Louis would create "much the shortest route from St. Louis to the heart of Colorado...." Gould as a promoter-salesman described the prospects of the new road in glowing terms. The line, he declared, would be built at such a low cost that it would realize handsome profits at rates very much lower than those which the Atchison had been compelled to charge "in order to sustain such a heavy load of capital."[^010_25] Gould offered $1,500,000 of the capital stock of a construction company to finance construction. The proposed new road was described in the Gould-owned New York daily as one calculated to open to the Denver "the entire Gould system east of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers."[^010_26]

Here was a typical Gould master stroke. The Atchison was too busy fighting its way into the Southwest to bother much about its eastern lines. It had accordingly left that flank open; there Gould made his attack. Gould as usual was acting in the twofold capacity of a stock operator and a businessman. In the former his campaign was immediately successful: the price of the Denver's voting certificates which he had bought in the fall at 22 advanced rapidly to 50 in January, 1880, and to 75 in February. As a railroad man his major objective was the termination of the war of duplicate construction. The Atchison was poised for a Pueblo-Denver line; the Denver for a Pueblo-Kansas line; the Burlington for a Nebraska-Denver line, and the Union Pacific for an extension into the mining region of southern Colorado. Gould took the lead in stabilizing this competitive clash which promised to unsettle the territorial equilibrium in the trans-Missouri River area. He controlled for the moment the corporate destinies of the Denver and could therefore dominate its construction policy. He was also the leading figure in the Union Pacific management and could regulate its decisions. By his threat to parallel the Atchison line in Kansas, he had brought this management to think in terms of conciliation and peace.

Gould still had the Burlington to consider. The officials of that road were convinced that an extension to Denver was essential to its welfare. The Burlington's officials understood that the building of a Denver line would intensify the war of duplicate construction. In view of the complex building and territorial problems on the middle and eastern end of its lines, peace if attainable on reasonable terms was desirable. If the roads in eastern Colorado would deliver eastbound business to the Burlington at the Missouri River, the Burlington would take the risk of not building—at least for the present.[^010_27]

An agreement reached early in March, 1880, set the pattern for railroad development for many years in eastern Colorado and in New Mexico. The Denver agreed not to build east of its north-south line; while the Atchison agreed not to build west of that line, nor north into Denver. For a cash consideration representing the cost of construction, the Atchison also surrendered its incompleted line into the mining regions, while Gould, speaking through the corporate instrumentality of the Denver, agreed to surrender the building of the line paralleling the Atchison from Pueblo east.[^010_28] The Union Pacific agreed that it would not construct or promote the construction of any competing line in Colorado south of the latitude of Denver on the Kansas Pacific. The Union Pacific and the Atchison, furthermore, agreed to divide the westbound mountain traffic equally; and to divide the Denver traffic, one-quarter to the Atchison and three-quarters to the Union Pacific. The eastbound traffic of Colorado and New Mexico originating west of the Denver-El Moro line of the Denver would be divided equally between the Union Pacific and the Atchison. All the three lines agreed also not to interchange traffic with any new railroad line. An oligopoly thus set itself up to dominate the Colorado railroad business. In still another understanding the B. & M. agreed with the Union Pacific not to extend to Denver; the Union Pacific in turn agreed to surrender the idea for which Gould fought in the spring of 1877—the Quintuple negotiations, thereby permitting the Burlington to carry all the business of the B. & M. The Union Pacific also approved the pooling of its business at the Missouri River with all its eastern connections, including the Burlington.

These were agreements with fundamental implications for the territorial development of the West. The Denver-Union Pacific-Atchison agreement which ran for ten years gave the Denver the business of the southern Colorado mining region, and the Atchison the traffic of the rich Arkansas Valley. The agreement also gave the traffic of New Mexico to the Atchison, thus opening the way for the latter's construction of a new route to California.

One more major competitive problem to the Union Pacific remains for consideration, viz., the water route via the Isthmus of Panama. In non-railroad hands the Pacific Mail controlling that route was a dangerous rate-cutter. Gould had no intention of letting it remain independent of railroad control. When he left its directorate in the spring of 1876 the company had a floating debt, of which he and Dillon, president of the Union Pacific, were the major holders. It is probable that Gould had contemplated the use of the floating debt as a means of reacquiring control of the company at a slight price. If this was his plan, he made a serious blunder. His efforts in this direction were blocked by the astute Park. The relinquishment of control of the Pacific Mail by Gould and his associates was followed by the ascendency of Park and his associates. No sooner had the new group acquired control than it addressed itself to the payment of the floating debt, each member of the new board subscribing individually to a fund which provided sufficient funds for its liquidation.[^010_29]

Gould was defeated. For the moment he had no ready-made plans with which to counter the thrust of Park. The result was a rate war between the Pacific Mail and the transcontinental railroads which soon spread to the Pacific where the Pacific Mail competed with the Occidental & Oriental—the line organized by Gould and Huntington to compete with the Pacific Mail for a share of the business of the far east. The rivalry between the ships of these two lines led to "ruinous prices" and to "a life and death fight."[^010_30] It was not until the summer of 1877 that an arrangement between the land and the water route was perfected. The contract which terminated the war suppressed competition. The Pacific Mail limited its coast-to-coast runs in exchange for a subsidy from the railroads. Although the business was to be solicited jointly by the steamship line and the railroads, the latter in the case of any difference had the right to make rates.[^010_31]

Despite these arrangements with the railroads, the Pacific Mail was able to discharge neither the advances made by the members of its board, nor its floating debt to the Panama. The stock meanwhile had become a low-priced speculation. The company paid no dividends, and there was no reasonable prospect of payment. Much of the stock was held by speculators who had bought at higher prices and who would not sell at the lower prices, and in part by traders buying and selling for quick turns. At the annual election in the spring of 1878 a group of outsiders led by Henry Hart, who had bought some of the stock at higher prices, seized control.

Gould was still an outsider, having rebought none of the stock which he had sold early in 1876. Developments in the Pacific Mail probably led him to believe that under the existing conditions it was not wise to reacquire any interest. Control under the existing conditions would hardly be worth while since the Panama by insisting on the payment of the floating debt could make the stock worthless. Instead of trying for control, therefore, Gould went off on a different tack. He decided to abandon the subsidy contract between the railroads and the Pacific Mail, and late in July, 1878, the Union Pacific gave the Pacific Mail notice that within sixty days it would cancel the contract. This was followed by one of those sudden moves which made it so difficult to follow Gould and to anticipate his next step. The Union Pacific changed its tariffs and classifications, increasing rates on many commodities from 50 to 100 per cent, at the same time eliminating its open tariffs under which the shippers were permitted to ship either by water or rail. It further announced that if any shipper agreed to move all of his freight by rail, especially low rates would be made. The scheme, which was not submitted to the board of directors, was devised by two freight agents and approved under verbal authority of the president and one of the directors.[^010_32] Presumably the director was Gould. Even before this advance, transcontinental freight rates were the highest in the country.

Gould had gone too far. Shippers refused to make special contracts with the transcontinental roads, and many decided to send their freight over the Pacific Mail. Early in August, after the increase in railroad rates, the Pacific Mail vessels filled up rapidly and the line made arrangements to run extra ships. A Pacific Mail director, enthusiastic over its prospects, said the company had determined to make no further contracts with the Union Pacific, and to operate its lines for the benefit of New York and California merchants on business principles.[^010_33] With the shippers refusing to accept the transcontinental roads' offer of lower rates in exchange for the exclusive movement of business over their lines, it became inevitable that either a price war or a pooling agreement had to follow. The negotiations were long and involved. By the end of that year another pool-subsidy agreement was arranged. The railroads agreed to increase the subsidy formerly paid the Pacific Mail, and the latter in turn permitted the railroads to fix rates.[^010_34]

The contract was hardly made before it was canceled. From time to time during the year negotiations were resumed. As the months rolled on in 1879 and early in 1880, it became evident that existing differences could not be reconciled, and finally in January of 1880 another war of rates broke out. The Pacific Mail reduced its first class New York to San Francisco passenger fares from $130 to $75. The Central and Union Pacific requested the roads east of Omaha to meet the cut by a corresponding reduction. The eastern roads refused. The Central Pacific then abandoned competition on first-class traffic, but slashed rates on coast-to-coast emigrant business to about one cent a mile.[^010_35]

The renewed competition was a serious threat to the earnings of the newly consolidated Union Pacific. Despite these impending disasters to the Pacific Mail, the price of its stock rose in spectacular fashion. Early in 1879 the stock had sold at a record low of little more than 10, while in March, 1880, it reached almost 60.

The key to this mystery was then being fashioned by Gould. While the stock speculators were selling, Gould was buying. And while critics and analysts were expatiating upon the dissolution of the Pacific Mail, Gould was planning to restore its power to earn profits and to pay dividends. He spent much time in 1879 in an effort to reconcile divergent interests, and early in the following year he succeeded in effecting an arrangement to which all companies were able to subscribe. The new Pacific Mail board elected in March contained representatives from all groups. The independently minded management of the Pacific Mail was ousted, Gould and Sage having bought up enough of the stock at the low prices prevailing in 1879 to enable them to take control. The rate war was eliminated, competition was suppressed, and a new contract providing for a fat subsidy to the Pacific Mail and the granting of rate-fixing power to the railroads was concluded.[^010_36]

Gould had won a notable success, and again everybody was happy. Those who had bought the Pacific Mail as a market speculation had a handsome stock-market profit, and those investors who had bought Pacific Mail as an investment were the beneficiaries of handsome dividends. The public interest, if not ignored, was certainly not consulted. A resolution was introduced into the Senate to investigate the pool. Although there was much discussion in Congressional circles and in the trade press, nothing was done.

To Gould the prospects were attractive. He had removed the last competitive obstacle to the progress of the Union Pacific, and on land as on water the Union Pacific had little opposition. It was free to charge rates on the basis of what the traffic could be made to bear. Although transcontinental rail opposition was being threatened, it was not yet serious, and of course there was only slight possibility in the immediate future of any new steamship competition. Thus the way was open for the formulation of investment judgment that the Union Pacific stock was a high-grade security. The price rose rapidly to new highs of between 100 and 130. Some of the stock cost Gould less than 10; while other shares cost him even less. With the suppression of competition, managed almost entirely by Gould, the stock looked good.

In 1881, a year after the merger, when the facts were clear to everyone, Union Pacific stock was "greedily bought" by Boston capitalists at over 130. "They have eyes and they see not." The investor's eyes sought only the past. The Union Pacific stock seemed to pass "into the ranks of the few dividend-paying stocks possessing a sufficiently solid position to withstand the brunt of bad times."[^010_37]

Not so to Gould. After the merger he was again the dominant factor. His eyes were wide open. He saw, and he sold. He supplied the investors with stock and they supplied him with cash.
